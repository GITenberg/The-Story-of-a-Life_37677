<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>The story of any life, if fully portrayed,
should be more interesting than the story of a
dream-phantom of fiction. In hearing of one
who really lived, there is with us the feeling
that the sunshine which greets our eyes, the
rain which dashes against our window, in
brief, the joys and sorrows which like flowers
and thistles grow everywhere, were all known
to that real character in the world's drama.
Therefore, since, in a measure, our experience
and his are in common, his life, inasmuch as it
touches us at so many points, should lead us
into new fields of interest and instruction, as it
goes on its way alone.</p>

<p>This is true of any life, if we could know
it in its entirety. But how much more strikingly
true it is found, when the life selected is
one that leads from the twilight dawn of
infancy to the twilight close of life, in one
straight line of definite desire and inspiring
achievement. It is the purpose of this book to
trace such a life, from the little bed in the
nursery, a bed of weakness and tears, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
huge pile of brick and stone which stands as a
monument to that life as if to show what may
be accomplished in spite of tears and weakness.</p>

<p>In the story of this life will be found stirring
scenes and distant travels; romance will
not be lacking; here and there the faces of
famous men and women will, for a moment,
appear; across the bloom of youth and hope
will fall the shadows of war. All these realities
will be presented in the colors of truth.
But something deeper than an interest in
connected links of a story is here to be found;
it shall be our endeavor to discover the causes
that lead to wider activities.</p>

<p>In endeavoring to divine, and clearly
reveal, the motives that prompt action, we
shall try to hold ourselves detached from the
subject, finding no fault, and indulging in no
encomium, defining beliefs and ambitions, not
because they are ours, but because they were
those of Mattie Myers, and, to understand her,
one must understand them.</p>

<p>It will not be sufficient to consider her
work, and the opinions of those who knew her,
in order to reach the desired result. As far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
possible, she shall speak out herself, out of her
old diaries and the abundance of her letters.
As her biographer, I would be but the setting
to uphold the gem, that it may shine by its
own light. And yet, there is no life whose
story may be fully understood, unless a knowledge
is gained of those other lives with which it
comes in contact. In the present story, this
truth is of wider significance than one finds in
the lives of the majority. Here will be painted
scenes as widely separated as Kentucky, Missouri,
Texas, Australia, England, and the
Levant.</p>

<h3>A KENTUCKY GIRL</h3>


<p>"I don't believe she's going to live
long," said the black nurse, mournfully
shaking her head. "She's so
thin and weak, and she cries nearly
every night!"</p>

<p>The nurse was speaking of little Mattie
Myers, who lived in the old Kentucky town of
Stanford. The child was seldom to be seen
engaged in those sports natural to children.
She was grave, quiet, thoughtful. Her one
amusement was found in her family of dolls;
she was always their teacher, and they were
daily going to school to her. For companions,
she chose those who were much older than herself,
and she would sit by the hour, soberly
listening to theological discussion, weighing, in
her infant mind, the arguments of learned men.</p>

<p>Her mother was dead, but Mattie could recall
her sympathetic touch, and tender smile.
It seemed to her that out of the shadow of
death her life had emerged, to be clouded by
new losses. One after the other, her two sisters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
were taken from her. Then the brother,
who was her only intimate companion, went to
another town to teach school. Mattie found
herself the only young person in the large
house of her wealthy father.</p>

<p>Of course she received all care; her slightest
wishes were granted; the love of her widowed
father was doubly hers, because of his bereavements.
But the little girl was very lonely.
When the flowers sent forth their perfume on
the warm Kentucky breezes, she was reminded
of three graves; and when the sunshine
gilded the level pike leading toward Lancaster,
she felt as if her brother Joe were calling her
to come and nestle against his loving breast.</p>

<p>At every turn, the big house in Stanford reminded
her of her mother's footsteps, her sisters'
voices forever hushed, and that beloved
brother from whom, for the first time, she
found herself separated. Is it a wonder that
the nights often witnessed her tears? Is it
strange that there should have grown up within
her, the intense desire to go to her brother?
She made this wish known to her father, and
her brother seconded her in the plan. Why
not stay with Joe during the school year?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Then they could spend the vacations at home,
together.</p>

<p>Henry Myers, the wealthy and influential
father, considered this proposition. He was
an ambitious man. He had spared no expense
in giving his son a thorough education. He
was pleased, now, to find that little Mattie
should show a disposition for learning. She
was only eight years old, and yet he felt that,
in the companionship of her brother, she would
find ample protection. Moreover, while a child
of eight is usually no fit inmate of a boarding-school,
and while it is not best to send one so
young, to dwell among strangers, Mattie was
no ordinary child.</p>

<p>Nor was her mother an ordinary woman.
Mary Burdette possessed a cultured and original
mind, related in sympathies to that of her
cousin who is known to the world, in the familiarity
of affection, as "Bob Burdette." When
Mrs. Mary Burdette Myers died, it was supposed
that Mattie was too young to appreciate
her loss. She could not, of course, appraise
that loss at its full value, but its shadow rested
upon her girlhood. This death, and that of
her sisters, had rendered her serious, had
brought enforced reflections upon death and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
immortality. The letters that she wrote, almost
to the days of maturity, are found inclosed
in faded little envelopes, which show the
black band of mourning.</p>

<p>No, there was no danger in sending Mattie
to Lancaster where brother Joe would be her
protector. Her father consented.</p>

<p>The ambition to teach school, entertained by
one who was a man of means, was a rare thing
in the South before the Civil War; or, at any
rate, it was rare in Kentucky. Yet that was
the ambition of Joe Myers, and to this ambition
he devoted his life. He was a natural
teacher, and Mattie, who admired him above
all others, imitated him in all things. What
he liked, she liked, and what he wanted to do,
she meant to do. The young man was very
fond of music&mdash;so was his little sister. He
opened up an academy at Lancaster&mdash;Mattie
established her first school, as we have seen&mdash;a
college of dolls.</p>

<p>When at last it was decided that Mattie
should go to Joe, great was her joy. Some of
those few golden hours of childhood, which she
afterward recalled, came to her then. She
went&mdash;the pike had not called in vain&mdash;but she
did not leave her dolls at home. She boarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
with her brother Joe Myers, and her education
began in earnest.</p>

<p>"I was only eight," she afterwards said,
"when I entered a boarding school; my whole
family of dolls matriculated with me."</p>

<p>Lancaster and Stanford were not far apart,
though in different counties. It was a short
journey to go home Friday evening, and visit
there until Monday morning. But of course
these visits were not of weekly occurrence.</p>

<p>There was Joe to stay with, and these two
never tired of each other's companionship. In
the twilight-hours, the young teacher would
play his flute, and the little girl would sit listening
with all her soul, translating his music
into definite resolves. Just as he had given his
life to teaching, so would she. She declared
her purpose at that age of eight. She would
teach a school&mdash;a school for girls. It was a
purpose she never changed.</p>

<p>Thus the years passed by, in sweet companionship
with her brother during the school
months, and with the reunited family every
summer. Mattie did not grow strong. The
black nurse still shook her head. "We never
thought she would live!" she often declared, in
after years.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime, Mattie still associated with
those who were much older than herself, still
found pleasure in discussion of religious differences.
We shall find her, at the age of
eighteen, saying that most of her friends are
married or dead, thus showing that no intimacies
existed between herself and girls of her
own age.</p>

<p>At twelve, a change came into her life. So
thoroughly had she pursued her studies at
Lancaster, that it was determined to send her
away to college. At that time, the strongest
college for girls of her father's faith, was at
Harrodsburg, Kentucky. The name of it was
"Daughters' College." Mattie's brother and
father, justly proud of her attainments, and
still resolved to encourage her in her desire to
become thoroughly educated, sent her to Harrodsburg
to be instructed by John Augustus
Williams, the President of "Daughters' College."</p>

<p>Boarding among strangers, now far from
home, Mattie found accentuated both her
spirit of self-reliance, and her attitude of reserve
toward others, two traits always shown
in her childhood. The six years at Harrodsburg
served to strengthen and deepen her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
already-preconceived ideals. John Augustus
Williams carried on the work that Joe Myers
had begun. The Harrodsburg President was
as devoted to learning as the Lancaster professor;
and he had farther penetrated its
depths. He was, indeed, a remarkable man,
one who magnified the dignity of his calling,
always conscious that the better he succeeded
as a teacher, the greater would prove his blessing
to the lives of others.</p>

<p>On Sunday we may follow the college girls
to church. There goes Mattie Myers, in her
solid-green woolen dress, her wonderful suit of
hair arranged as plainly as such a wealth of
heavy brown will permit. We see the neat and
unpretentious hat from under which appear
the serious brow, and the eyes always bright
and intelligent. We note her reliant step; her
form, too thin; her face a little weary from
over-hard studying.</p>

<p>Shall we not enter this church on Main
street, and watch the young ladies as they seat
themselves in a bright oblong of femininity, if
not of beauty?</p>

<p>We shall certainly do so, if we are young
ministerial students, attending the University!
Unfortunately, young Oliver Carr cannot enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
with us, for he is still over yonder at May's
Lick; but never mind&mdash;he will presently be
coming down to find out what Latin is like!
What happy fortune has brought the University
for young men into the same town that
affords a college for young ladies? That, too,
we shall presently understand.</p>

<p>At any rate, here sits Mattie Myers, decorously
listening, it would appear&mdash;we hope she is
not thinking about her studies&mdash;while Dr.
Robert Richardson, or Robert Graham, or Robert
Milligan&mdash;all teachers at the University
(among whom "Robert" seems a favorite
name)&mdash;preaches and preaches. About what?
Why, about what we must do to be saved, to
be sure. And Mattie listening eagerly&mdash;for of
course she listens&mdash;finds that these distinguished
men agree entirely with her father,
that what we must do to be saved is very much
like what Peter declared we must do&mdash;nay, is
exactly what Peter declared, to the very words.
Far, indeed, is it from the mind of this thin,
erect girl in the dress of solid-green, and under
the hair whose splendor refuses to be concealed&mdash;far
is it from her mind that any young man
of the Kentucky "froglands" is ever to enter
her life as an integral part!</p>

<p>Little time is there for day dreams for this
child!&mdash;Little time, and no inclination. Study&mdash;ever
deeper and more persistent study for
her; late hours after the lamps are out, sitting
in the window with long hair streaming, borrowing
favor from the moon&mdash;that means spectacles
in no very short time! Study&mdash;ever more
absorbed, and absorbing study, at noon-recess,
in early morning, on holidays&mdash;till the
form grows thinner, the face paler; and, indeed,
she had better have a care, or all this will come
to an end, with pain and disappointment!</p>

<p>The sermon is nearly ended. Are you
sorry you missed it? An hour and a quarter,
already! Do the school girls move uneasily in
the straight-backed benches? Let us hope
they are entertained by this searching examination
of sectarian "positions." How new
that church building seems to them! Why, it
was finished only a few years ago&mdash;that is to
say, in 1850. There was a time when two
bodies of believers met in Harrodsburg; one
organized by the followers of Barton Stone,
who called themselves "Christians", another
the "disciples" who had followed John Smith
and John T. Johnson out of the Baptist
church. The Christians met from house to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
house; the "disciples" in the old frame building
at the corner of South Main and Depot
streets, nearly opposite the public square.
Each body was suspicious of the other till, one
day, they found out that they taught the same
things, believed the same truths, were, in
short, blood-brothers of faith and practice.
So they came together and formed the church
which Mattie is attending. She comes every
Sunday; and every Sunday you will find, if you
examine her closely, that she is a little paler,
a little weaker. Working too hard! The end
must come if this is kept up, year after year.</p>

<p>We find the girl subject to an unappeasable
hunger for facts. Is she not to devote her life
to teaching her sex? Now is the time to store
the mind. John Augustus Williams spurs her
on, leads her into untold scientific difficulties;
lets her realize how little is her strength; then
aids by teaching her to help herself. One
thing he does not help her do&mdash;that is to husband
her physical forces. As he stands before
his "daughters" in chapel he hammers away
at this idea:</p>

<p>"Teaching is woman's profession and her
natural vocation. No lady can claim to be
well educated, therefore, or trained for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
proper sphere in life, until she has learned to
teach, and to govern the young. The learning
which prepares her for the school-room, prepares
her at the same time for the highest
social and domestic position. No time is lost
by such a training, even should the student
never become a professional teacher."</p>

<p>It is no wonder that the enunciation of these
ideas strengthened the girl's resolutions. Here
was the most learned man she had ever met in
daily life, a polished speaker, a graceful author,
a correct translator; one who reads the pages
of his manuscript, "The Life of John Smith,"
that his class may parse it;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> a preacher, too,
who pointed the way back to Pentecost. Wisdom
flowed from his lips, and his lips proclaimed
teaching the "natural vocation" of woman.</p>

<p>And the way in which this teaching was to
be done&mdash;in a word, his conception of what an
education means&mdash;that justified his dictum.
He said over and over again:</p>

<p>"You have an infallible criterion by which
you may determine the success of your own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and your teacher's labors. If you feel in
your heart a greater susceptibility to truth, a
livelier appreciation of the purely beautiful, a
profounder regard for virtue, a warmer affection
for the good, and sublimer devotion to
God, esteem your labors as eminently successful;
but if your attainments, varied and extensive
as they may be, are to render you less amiable
in disposition, or less pure in thought&mdash;less
charitable to your fellows, or less devoted
to God, then have we labored in vain, and your
learning, also, has been in vain."</p>

<p>To such a teacher as this, every year is a
book written full of sweet influences,&mdash;books
far deeper and more permanent than any work
of the pen. The girl understood this; that is
why her determination to be a teacher grew
and ripened; not to impart facts but, by means
of facts, to inculcate the love of learning and of
truth. She wanted to come into touch with the
world, and to send the ripple of her personal
influence far out into those magic circles of infinite
distance, which the casting of an idea
forms on the sea of thought. She wanted
girls, many girls, countless girls,&mdash;to receive a
higher view of life by having known her; to
enter more fully into the inheritance of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
estate through her ministration. No other relation
than that of teacher and pupil, could
connect this circuit of spiritual influence.</p>

<p>Teachers&mdash;the world was full of them in
those days, just such as they are now; teachers
who bend beneath their burden, who seek in their
business but a means of livelihood, and who
are ready to lay aside the textbook and close
the desk, when fortune smiles: who see their
day's end at four o'clock, and their happiness,
at the dawn of vacation. But there have always
been, of teachers, a few who regarded
their work as Williams regarded his, and who,
as in Mattie's case, with no spur of necessity,
selected it from all careers the future had to offer.</p>

<p>But we do not mean that these highest ambitions
of a teacher's sovereign realm took definite
shape in the girl's mind in her twelfth
year; for see! She is no longer twelve, but thirteen&mdash;fourteen&mdash;
fifteen&mdash;how fast she is getting her education!&mdash;sixteen&mdash;</p>

<p>And then the blow fell&mdash;we said it would!&mdash;hours
too late, and thought too intense, and
eyes too severely taxed! Has it been for nothing,
after all? She must flutter back home,
now, like a disabled bird; high ideas all lost in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
a maze, definite purposes fused white-hot in a
raging fever.</p>

<p>Not only so, but in her sudden breakdown
of vital force, there is no one to understand the
despair over her own weakness, except, indeed,
that brother Joe who alone understands her.
Mother and father are both dead, now; and
the sisters who are proud of her attainments&mdash;for
she had finished in the Junior Year at
Daughters' College,&mdash;wonder that she is not
satisfied. Is it not enough? Already she is
"educated."</p>

<p>And she is sixteen; and her inheritance assures
her of future freedom from necessity. It
will be a long time, the doctors say, before she
can resume her studies&mdash;a year, at least;
maybe two. But does that matter? In two
years she will be of age, and rich, or nearly so,
in her own right.</p>

<p>"And then," said brother Joe, "I will find
her a rich husband, and see her handsomely
established for life!"</p>

<p>Not that Joe had himself married; he was
too busy teaching school, and too absorbed in
his beloved work; but he felt the responsibility
of his guardianship. Mattie was too ill, too
broken in spirit, to combat his plans or to form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
any of her own. She could only lie silent and,
suffering, uncertain of the outcome.</p>

<p>Leaving her thus, as we found her at the
beginning, in suffering and tears, let us make a
journey to Mason County, in search of that
possible husband. He may not prove so rich
as brother Joe could desire. We shall see.</p>

<p>But no, the biographer, on second
thought, will not go up to May's Lick
in the present chapter. Let that
expedition be reserved for Chapter
Third. And let those who care for
the story of lives merely for events, not for
motive-springs of action, skip the present chapter,
if they will. It will be to their loss, if they
do so; for what life is to be understood, without
an understanding of the principles that
direct its course?</p>

<p>In the life we are seeking to trace, there were
three great principles that shaped events. The
first has already been amplified&mdash;the resolve to
become a teacher of girls. The other two must
be defined&mdash;one's thought of country, and
one's religious faith.</p>

<p>In those days, a man who had no opinion on
the "slavery question," or on the "current
reformation," was no true Kentuckian. If
one has slaves, his children are not only disposed
to regard slavery as right, but as highly
fortunate and desirable. Also, when one's religion
is being placed on trial at every crossroad's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>

household have some opinions on the Gospel
Restored, on Election, on Baptism.</p>

<p>In the veins of Mattie Myers flowed Southern
blood, and it was with the South that she
sympathized with all that fire of young enthusiasm
that characterized Southern adherents in
those days. As for her religion, that calls for
more particular description, because it is indistinguishably
blended with all her emotions and
purposes. It was no more Mattie's intention
to become a teacher of girls, than it was to
spread a knowledge of the Gospel as she herself
understood it.</p>

<p>In portraying the belief of this child&mdash;a belief
that time served only to strengthen&mdash;it is far
from our thought to influence the particular
faith of the reader. That biographer is unworthy
of his task who allows his own opinions
to color his narrative. What I believe has no
more to do with the life of Mattie Myers, than
has the belief of the reader; and this is the
story of a life, not a controversy in disguise.</p>

<p>But at the same time, it is not only due
the reader, but the object of the biography,
that the faith of Mattie should be presented so
clearly and so fairly that no one can fail to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
understand what it was. I shall do my utmost
to make it plain. It occupied too great a part
of the girl's life and the woman's life, to be
ignored. As she sat at her father's knee in
Stanford, as she rested with her brother on
the porch of the boarding-house in Lancaster,
as she made her stage-journeys, in short, where-ever
she was, she heard religion discussed in all
its phases. And that phase which appealed
to her was the same that Walter Scott&mdash;kinsman
of the illustrious novelist&mdash;had proclaimed
from state to state.</p>

<p>One peculiarity of this faith was, that whoever
accepted it with zeal, became more or less
antagonistic, combative. It was not because
it despised peace, although peace, in later years
has sometimes proved fatal to it; but it was
because every hand seemed turned against it.
Had it asked for peace in 1850, that petition
would doubtless have been derided.</p>

<p>And why? Because an acceptance of this
faith meant an end to all creeds, to all sects,
to all denominational barriers. Therefore all
denominations felt that the faith of Mattie
Myers had raised its hand against them.
When Walter Scott and his co-workers prayed
the Savior's prayer that all might be one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
what&mdash;if that prayer be granted&mdash;was to become
of the <i>many</i>?</p>

<p>It may be true, in the Twentieth Century,
that one need only have enough money to hire
a hall, in order to start a new religion; that
Society has but to smile upon the dancing of
Dervishes to popularize Orientalism; that a
woman, by the writing of a book, can convince
intelligent thousands that diseases are but
delusions of their mortal minds&mdash;perhaps instincts
would be a better word, since unimaginative
quadrupeds sometimes "think" themselves
sick. But whether this is true or not, it
is certain that, in the first half of the Nineteenth
Century, it required much more than
money, and more than the writing of many
books, this endeavor to re-establish the old religion
of Pentecost. It called for courage, firmness
and ability; it invited persecution and misrepresentation.</p>

<p>"I would rather," an aunt of Oliver Carr
once declared&mdash;herself a stern soldier of the
Cross&mdash;"see you go to your grave, than have
you join the Campbellite Church!"</p>

<p>What was this "Campbellite Church" of
which some spoke thus disparagingly? And
why "Campbellite"? And why did the denominations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
regard the people they thus designated
much as, at a later day, the Mormons were
regarded? Before we enter into details, it is
enough at this point to emphasize the fact of
general intolerance. To worship God in your
own way is the right of all; and no man disputes
that inborn right, so long as you agree
with him in your religious belief. The Puritans
were ready to sacrifice their lives to preserve religious
freedom, and to take the lives of those
who desired a separate freedom.</p>

<p>In the first half of the Nineteenth Century,
more especially in the first quarter, the jangling
and wrangling among different sects was almost
inconceivable. It would appear that often
where differences of tenets were but slight, the
fight was the more determined, as if the possibility
of preserving a denominational integrity,
depended largely upon keeping alive a spirit of
hostility to all other denominations. Happily
that spirit of antagonism has largely died out,
and men are not so ready to take each other by
the throat because they are seeking to gain
Heaven by different ways. This tendency to
minimize differences of speculative opinions, and
to draw close to each other on the fundamental
truths as they are revealed in the life, death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and resurrection of Jesus Christ, is doubtless in
a large measure due to the pioneers of that
faith which Mattie Myers had accepted, and
which, at the time of her acceptance, was the
object of so much bitterness and ridicule.</p>

<p>Thirty years had already passed since Walter
Scott and Alexander Campbell first proclaimed
their views in the "Christian Baptist." The
distracted state of the religious world had
grieved many a pious and erudite soul before
1819. In looking for a solution to the amazing
perplexities that baffled the seeker after God,
in trying to avoid the anomalous condition of
changing a gospel of love to a gospel of interminable
disputation, the solution proposed by
Thomas Campbell was a return to the practices
and faith of the early disciples. This solution
was urged by Walter Scott and Alexander
Campbell. What more simple? Everybody
should be willing to accept the Bible; everybody
should be willing to discard everything
else!</p>

<p>In brief, then, that was the work of the
"current reformation." It would call for a
sacrifice of individual opinions, of sectarian
names and dogmas, of that poetic atmosphere
which time bestows upon any organization, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
those intimate human associations derived from
a commingling with relatives and friends whom
a common rule of practice holds together. As
a recompense for this sacrifice, was offered the
privilege of returning to the Apostolic faith and
manner of worship, the sense of security that
should spring from following closely in the footsteps
of the earliest disciples, and the privilege
of performing one's part in the realization of
the prayer of the Savior of mankind.</p>

<p>Alexander Campbell's life was given to this
fundamental idea&mdash;that the world should go
back, in its religious beliefs and practices, nineteen
hundred years, to learn again the conditions
of its salvation from the lips of Christ's
apostles. Campbell himself, was but a voice
calling in the wilderness. He seemed always to
be crying, "Look back! Behold the Lamb of
God!" As for himself, he would have been
but the medium through which an enlightened
vision might see that glorious spectacle of God
in man. "Do not regard me," he seemed to
say, "For I am nothing. I am but a voice&mdash;a
voice proclaiming no new doctrine, only the old;
asking you not to originate a new faith, but to
remember the old. Look back! Behold the
Lamb of God!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>But the world did not wish to look back. It
exclaimed that these people who pretended to do
away with all sects, were themselves the narrowest
sect of all. These preachers who proclaimed
that there was but one church, were
accused of "wanting to get us into their church."
The result was endless debates. We have seen
that the denominations were at war with one
another; but all of them became more or less
cohesive, in their attack upon these people who
claimed to be no denomination.</p>

<p>If Campbell and his friends urged that
baptism should be administered as in the days
of the Apostles, the cry was immediately raised
that "These men believe in nothing but baptism."
If their editors asked for an instance
of infant baptism between the lids of the Bible,
it was retorted that "They have only a head
religion&mdash;they don't believe in a change of
heart." If a preacher said no more about baptism
than did Peter on Pentecost, his listeners
went away observing that "he believed water
would save him." If nothing was said about
baptism, if on the contrary, the discourse were
concentrated upon the idea that all Christians
should follow the same rule and practice,
should dwell together in one great homogeneous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
body, it was charged, "That is really another
way of saying that immersion is the only mode
of baptism." If, by dint of innumerable repetitions,
Herculean efforts at self-restraint,
monotonous insistence, these "reformers" succeeded
in convincing the antagonist of the fact
that nobody believed water would save him,
and every Christian believes in a change of
heart, all this laborious and indefatigable endeavor
went for nothing.</p>

<p>"Well, maybe you do believe in a change of
heart," it would at last be conceded, "but
your church don't." Or "Maybe <i>you</i> don't
believe water will save you, but your church
does."</p>

<p>Such as the views of the disciples of Christ
really were, Mattie Myers had received them at
first hand. Her father was one of the "new
faith." His home had from her earliest recollections,
been a rallying point for the sturdy
pioneers of the "Old Jerusalem Gospel." In
that home, "Raccoon" John Smith and Barton
W. Stone had held her upon their knees.
She had seen Walter Scott and Alexander
Campbell in childhood, and had heard L. L.
Pinkerton's eloquence, and Robert Milligan's
logic. She knew the matters debated, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
arguments that sustained each side in its opinion,&mdash;and
she could point out the verse of
scripture that seemed to substantiate every
claim of her friends, and to confound those of
the enemy. And she knew how families had
become divided; how bitterness crept in between
life-long friends; how misunderstanding
led to misrepresentation, and argument to vilification,
and disapproval to hatred.</p>

<p>Whatever else the plea of the disciples accomplished,
it led to a closer study of the scriptures;
and to a fuller admission of their authority.
This was inevitable because the adherents
of what was disparagingly called the "new religion,"
based all their positions upon the Word
of God. Even farther than that they went, in
declaring that they entertained no doctrine not
fully presented in the New Testament; they
were willing to relinquish any belief, no matter
how dear, on being shown that it was not
divinely authorized.</p>

<p>It was futile to meet such claims by references
to any other book than that of the inspired
writers, unless those books were lexicons and
dictionaries devoted to an explanation of biblical
terms. To the lexicons, the friends and enemies
of the "reformation" did indeed go.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
There were times when, if Polycarp, or Chrysostum,
or even Sophocles, or Plato, could have
stepped into the debating-room, he might have
fancied himself just awakened from his long
sleep, to hear confused murmurs in his native
tongue.</p>

<p>Under this awful weight of learning, the
brain sometimes staggered. To the imprudent,
to the rash, to the over-zealous, vital
truths might, at times, be half-obscured, in
showing the eunuch as he went down into the
water&mdash;<i>eis</i>, into; ah! shall we ever forget that <i>eis</i>
with its suggestion of the cooling tide?&mdash;Into
the water, then, the eunuch descended; and
good care was taken that he should not be left
there. The jailer, too,&mdash;was there no water in
the courtyard? And Lydia's household&mdash;what
right has one to presume her mistress
over a nursery? At these debates, even the
eloquent Henry Clay may act as moderator,
generously appreciative of the eloquence of A.
Campbell. So, as we have said, the theme may
at times grow obscured with a sort of Greek
mist; but out of this mist there rises, at last, a
face of meekness and suffering beneath its
crown of thorns&mdash;a crown of thorns, dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
reader, which the Son of God wore that you
and I might wear crowns of glory.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that here is a religion
which its opponents refused to take at its
face value. Its adherents wished to be called
only by Bible names, such as Christians, or
disciples of Christ. Their opponents called
them "Campbellites." These disciples claimed
that they had gone back to the days of the beginning
of the church, to find there the true
standard of faith and practice. Their opponents
said they had started a new religion, and
that it dated from the days of Alexander Campbell.
The disciples said that they added nothing
to the Word of God, took from it nothing;
that where the Bible was silent they were silent,
that where it spoke they spoke; that, in matters
of opinion, everyone might think what he
pleased, but that, in matters of essentials, there
should be unity. The opponents said that as
a matter of fact, the religion of the reformers
was a religion of the head, and that its central
idea was baptism.</p>

<p>"You do not believe that baptism is necessary
to salvation," the disciples said; "then
why do you baptize?"</p>

<p>"Aha!" the old cry was raised, "you think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
water will save you!" And then the begrudged
concession, "Well, if <i>you</i> don't believe it, your
church does!"</p>

<p>In a word, then, the individual adherents of
the religion were allowed to hold opinions contrary
to what the adherents as a whole, were
supposed to believe; while, at the same time,
not one adherent of the religion could be found
who professed to hold the views that the opponents
of the religion ascribed to all the brotherhood!
This was not from a willful determination
to misrepresent, but rather from a sense
of generous good-will. It was the only way to
rescue one's kindred and friends from the inevitable
hell that awaits the adherents of heretical
doctrines.</p>

<p>"Tom is a good man," said a devout adherent
of the established order of things, referring
to minister Thomas Arnold of the Kentucky
disciples, "but he preaches a lie and will
be damned for it!" And the way to save one's
beloved from this damnation was to believe that
they did not really hold the views of these Ishmaelites
of the "new religion," but were
"Baptists at heart"&mdash;or Pedobaptists, according
to one's point of view.</p>

<p>Thomas Campbell's "Declaration and Address"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
appeared in 1809; but it was not until
September, 1832 that the first general meeting
of the disciples of Christ was held, in Lexington,
Kentucky. Everyone understood that
such an assemblage had no authority over local
organizations. Christian soldiers came together
to talk over their victories and defeats,
and to plan for fresh campaigns. As time
passed by, such men as John T. Johnson and
John I. Rogers were appointed state evangelists;
but they were supported by several
churches combining to furnish the funds.</p>

<p>At the time Mattie Carr was boarding at
her brother's school, there was no general
board behind missionary enterprises. But later
a convention met at Harrodsburg and employed
four evangelists; that was in 1857. The next
year sixteen were employed, and in a year they
won 1,936 converts to the church. The year
following, twenty evangelists added to the faith
2,020. The "new religion" was growing at
an unheard of rate, and the more it grew the
hotter raged the noise of battle and the clash
of arms.</p>

<p>It is in such circumstances as these that one
learns to weigh one's own opinion, to use it, if
need be, as a battering-ram against the opinions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of other folk; that one learns to realize the importance
of self-reliance, self-defense, self-assertion.
Before Mattie Myers was twelve years
old, the leading purposes of her after-life were
already crystalized in thought and determination.
It will be interesting to watch how she
adhered to these principles, and whither they
brought her at last. As we have said, they
were three in number, more or less commingled
in her girlhood's plans of life; an unwavering
devotion to the South; a fixed resolve to become
a teacher of girls; and a conviction
that the plea of the disciples of Christ was the
need of the world.</p>

<h3>A KENTUCKY BOY.</h3>


<p>It was while the black nurse was
doubtfully shaking her head over the
prospect of a long life for Mattie
Myers, that two boys presented themselves
at the village schoolhouse of
May's Lick, Kentucky. They were two brothers
who resembled each other so closely, and
were so inseparable, that they were often
thought to be twins. Oliver Carr, however,
was two years younger than Owen<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. They had
come up from the country in the old family
barouche, and the fact that they were from the
country, was shown in their movements and
their dress.</p>

<p>Their father, while still on the farm in Lewis
County, had declared, "I will educate my
children, if I don't leave them a cent when I
die." That is why he sold his farm to invest
the proceeds in town property at May's Lick;
and that is why Owen and Oliver are presenting
themselves at the door of May's Lick Academy.
The family that had just moved to town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
consisted of William Carr and his wife, and
their four sons and three daughters. Of the
children, the only one essential to this narrative
is he who gave his name to the teacher as Oliver
A. Carr&mdash;better known in his family and
among his young companions as "Ollie."</p>

<p>The year was 1857. Of all the proud towns
of Kentucky&mdash;proud of blood and wealth&mdash;no
city was prouder than May's Lick. Not even
Lexington, five counties to the southwest,
thought more of her high birth, her fine horses,
her opulence, than did this little May's Lick of
Mason County. The schoolmates of the Carrs
were the children of the wealthy. The boys
came to school in red-topped boots, riding
prancing ponies, and were waited upon by their
black bodyguards. The girls were, petted, and
spoiled, clad in dainty apparel, born to refinement
and a nicety of taste, intolerant of whatever
appeared to their sensitive minds as "common."
Nor was this superiority of manner
merely superficial. Beneath the gleam of showy
beauty, there was the gold of culture.</p>

<p>Naturally enough, these children of the rich,
whether on the play-ground, or in the school-room,
stood aloof from Owen and Oliver,&mdash;or
as they were called "Bud and Ollie." In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
first place, they were newcomers; again, they
were awkward and their clothes were made
from the same piece of their mother's weaving;
and their father had purchased one of the two
hotels in town. "He works, himself!" it was
said, with pity, or contempt. And the sentiment
against William Carr because his work
was not done by slaves, was reflected against
his seven children.</p>

<p>But William Carr, rugged and unyielding,
firm in his belief that education would place his
boys and girls on a footing with the best, conducted
the hotel, while his wife, patient and
tireless, sewed long after the hours of the day's
inevitable work were ended. To clothe and
educate seven children while all the time one's
cashier is stealing systematically&mdash;that is the
problem!</p>

<p>It is a problem that little concerns the lads
of the red-topped boots and prancing ponies,
or the girls of fine laces,&mdash;still less the fathers
of these; for all their spare time is spent in
reminiscences of Henry Clay, and in defining
differences between the North and South&mdash;for
this is 1857, as we have said, and in a few years
something may happen.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is not given to every boy to wear red-tops,
nor to every girl, real lace. Of course
there were other families falling under the supercilious
classification of "those who do their own
work." At such times as the Carrs were not
studying, or reciting to L. P. Streater, or helping
at home, companions were to be found, to
bear a hand at a game of marbles. Oliver had
the genius of making friends; and, when no
artificial barriers interposed, his gentle nature
thawed the ice in natures most reserved.</p>

<p>Sometimes it happened that, as Oliver and
his friends were engaged in sports along the
roadside, they would see a venerable man drawing
near, smooth faced, broad browed, stately
in bearing, kindly in expression. If it chanced
to be a time of heated altercation, the warning
would go round&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hush! hush! There comes Brother Walter
Scott."</p>

<p>The old man would pause with, "Well,
dears, how do you do, this nice morning? Are
you on your way to school?"</p>

<p>Then he would pat one on the head, and say
a pleasant word to all. In his presence ill-humor
melted away, and evil purposes were
corrected. It was not only so with the school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
boys, but with their fathers. His very presence
seemed a rebuke to wrong-doing and wrong-thinking.
Sometimes he came to the Academy
and addressed the pupils. Oliver stood at the
head of the class in mathematics. One day
after reciting geometry, "Elder" Scott, as he
was called&mdash;or "Brother" Scott&mdash;said, with
that gracious smile which lent the aspect of
perennial youth to his wrinkled face,</p>

<p>"Young gentlemen, you have made good
progress in Euclid." It was the first time Oliver
had ever heard of Euclid, but he knew the
enunciation of every proposition in the first five
Books, and had drawn the figures with elaborate
care on his father's barn door! But he had
not studied Latin.</p>

<p>"That language," said his practical father,
"is dead!"</p>

<p>The almost daily meeting with Walter Scott
was one of those formative influences, unperceived
at the time, which help to shape one's
ideals. Let us look for a moment at this
benign figure with his gentle smile, his keen,
penetrating glance, and his still almost raven-black
locks. He had brought to the Kentucky
village an atmosphere of the great outside
world, for he was a man who had not only come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
in touch with the great and illustrious, but who
had himself participated in great affairs.</p>

<p>It meant much to the young mathematician
at May's Lick Academy, this daily intercourse
with such a man. It inevitably raised his mind
above the daily toil, the unstimulating routine
of a small town; it gave him a certain outlook
upon a wider life, suggesting higher things
than had hitherto entered his experience.</p>

<p>This venerable Walter Scott&mdash;he who had
held little Mattie Myers upon his knee&mdash;was a
man in whose veins flowed the blood of Wat, of
Hardin&mdash;most illustrious of Scottish heroes.
He was kin to the creator of <i>Ivanhoe</i> and
<i>Rebecca</i>; a man who had graduated from the
University of Edinburg; who had sailed the
seas and traveled in many distant scenes; whose
music instructor had been the friend of Sir
Ralph Abercrombie; who had been by turn
teacher, preacher, editor, author; who had
traversed the circular avenues of poplars and
pines leading to the mansion-house of Henry
Clay, trees "which made me fancy myself once
more in Scotia",&mdash;and who had sat in Clay's
parlor in charming intercourse with the statesman
while the portrait of Washington looked
down, and the elegant simplicity of the apartments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
presented nothing "to make poor men
afraid, or rich men ashamed;" who had ridden
on the steamboat with the distinguished companionship
of General Schuyler's daughter, the
widow of Alexander Hamilton, then in her
eighty-fourth year; who had visited the home
of Colonel Richard M. Johnson; and who,
finally, had come to May's Lick to pass the
remainder of his days.</p>

<p>It was natural enough that the very sight of
this man should suggest to the studious youth,
thoughts of greatness and of travel. His kinship
to Sir Walter Scott and his familiarity
with the lands beyond the seas, no doubt lent
him a sort of halo, to the imagination of boyhood.
But it must have done more than this;
it must have suggested that one need not remain
poor and unknown; and that, as Walter
Scott, when a poor young man had lifted himself
above his condition by means of his education,
so might Oliver Carr.</p>

<p>The postoffice was in William Carr's hotel.
William was the postmaster, and during vacation,
or at intervals, Oliver served as deputy.
After the arrival of the mail, the distinguished
scholar, Walter Scott, would appear at the
counter with his benignant smile, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
"Dear&mdash;" he called all young people thus&mdash;"Dear, is there anything for me, this morning?"</p>

<p>And Oliver was as pleased as he, when there
was a <i>Louisville Courier</i> to hand his friend,
or a letter from Ohio, or Pittsburg, or New
York.</p>

<p>There remains a word to be said as to what
this Walter Scott was; for, after all, where one
has traveled, or whom one has met, speaks little
of the inner self; and it was this personal
value of the man that counted most with those
he met.</p>

<p>It was in 1819 that Walter Scott landed in
New York, and began teaching Latin in Long
Island&mdash;diverting himself with his flute at the
close of the day. But he soon felt the call of the
West, and obeyed it afoot. It brought him to
Pittsburg, where he found himself drawn into
school work again. He became an assistant in
the Academy conducted by Mr. Forrester, a
fellow-countryman. Scott had been reared in
the Presbyterian faith, and his soul had been
perfectly satisfied in those religious grounds
staked off by his denomination's creed. He
had not associated long with Forrester before
he found to his amazement that the latter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
though apparently of sincere piety, did not
subscribe to all the articles; but, instead of
seeking to attack the Confession with the Discipline
or the Prayer Book, had recourse to the
Bible. Not only so, but Forrester professed
himself ready to give up any article of faith
that did not appear fully warranted by the
Scriptures; or, in other words, he had resolved
to be guided in religious matters by the Bible
alone.</p>

<p>It is difficult for one of the present day to
realize how radical, unheard of, and unorthodox,
such a determination as Forrester's appeared
in the year 1819. It is true that men
here and there, in places far removed from one
another, were beginning to weary of the burden
of the creeds; they were reaching out to grasp
something that might pull their feet from the
shackles of doubt or predetermined damnation,
and in desperate blindness they seized upon the
Word of God as likely to prove of most avail.
It was, indeed, heresy; for if all had deserted
creeds for the Bible, what would have become
of the creeds? In Luther's day it had been
heretical to decry Indulgences; if a Baptist, it
was heretical not to believe "in the peculiar and
eternal election of men and angels to glory,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and "in a particular redemption of a definite
number of persons to eternal life," and "the
final perseverance of the saints in grace to the
end."</p>

<p>Walter Scott felt no hesitation in joining
Forrester in his studies of the New Testament,
secure in the belief that nothing could be found
there, inconsistent with his creed; henceforth,
we find him sitting far into the night, no longer
solacing himself with the music of his flute, but
studying the Bible with ever greater and greater
perplexity; studying it as diligently as ever he
had studied the Confession; studying it with
increasing uneasiness, as it seemed to lead him
from the faith of his fathers.</p>

<p>There was, at that time, no body of associated
men who had agreed to surrender all creeds,
and take the Bible as their only guide. There
were isolated examples of such men. Alexander
Campbell, of whom Walter Scott had never
heard, had been forced by his convictions from
the Presbyterian church into the Baptist association.
Not long after the beginning of
Scott's explorations into this dimly-known
field of original research, he and the celebrated
scholar met; but neither had a thought of
breaking away from the accepted religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
bodies; the only question was to find the one
nearest approximating the truth, and to seek
reformation within that body.</p>

<p>The result of that effort to bring back the
primitive church upon earth, is seen today in
the church of the disciples of Christ. This is
not the place to argue the feasibility of the
plea, or to adduce arguments against it. But
what that plea was, should be presented clearly
and dispassionately. It is not the office of
the biographer to point out the right or wrong
of his subject's dominating ideas, so much as
it is to show how the life was influenced by
those motive-springs of thought.</p>

<p>Walter Scott, as an evangelist, pastor, author
and editor, had come into contact with
tens of thousands, and had influenced countless
lives. His followers were called by the unsympathetic,
"Scottites," just as those of Alexander
Campbell were nicknamed "Campbellites."
Thomas and Alexander Campbell
and Walter Scott, the triumvirate of the dawning
"Reformation," did not come, however, to
found denominations, but, so far as they could,
to do away with them.</p>

<p>They believed that it was possible for the
church of New Testament days to exist in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
modern world, just as it had existed then.
They believed that the means of entering the
church now, are what they were then; that
Christ's conditions were in their very nature of
divinity, unalterable. As Peter preached on
the day of Pentecost, so Walter Scott preached
in the Nineteenth Century. As Cornelius and
the jailer and the eunuch and Lydia and all
other recorded instances of sinners converted in
olden times, so man today, in turning to God,
must turn as they turned, come as they came,
obey as they obeyed.</p>

<p>And if the old order should be restored, there
would be but one order in the earth; but one
Faith, one Lord and one Baptism. The saints
would sit down to one table from which no
saint would be excluded; they would join their
hymns of undenominational ecstasy, and, if
they did not see every subject exactly alike,
they would at least agree in their contemplation
of essentials. After all, the important matter
seemed to be, to get safely into the church, and
to stay in it; and if all entered in the same way,
the way the apostles had taught, and then
dwelt in harmony, not as Presbyterians and
Baptists and Episcopals and Methodists,
whose very names appeared to draw lines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
whether the lines were definitely understood or
not&mdash;this ideal body would be simply disciples
of Christ, or Christians, as they had been
eighteen hundred years ago. Then indeed
would a shout of thanksgiving go up from the
earth, that the prayer of Jesus had been
answered; not only his apostles but all those
who now believed on his name, had become
one; one in thought and love and life; one as he
and the Father were one, eternal, indivisible.</p>

<p>Whether or not the reader believes such a
union possible, or desirable, it will surely call
for no great task of the imagination upon his
part, to enter somewhat into the thrilling rapture
this picture presented to the hearts of the
early "reformers." One feels his heart leap
with a sympathetic throb when men who had
dreamed of such a return to the old paths, but
who had dreamed of it in solitude, not knowing
it had found a voice in the earth&mdash;suddenly
heard it pronounced from the pulpit. Men
who had brooded in seclusion over their Bibles,
finding there, as it appeared to them, sublime
statements antagonistic to sectarianism, were
suddenly transfixed by hearing the words of
old, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
thou shalt be saved!" It seemed to them that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the "Old Gospel" was once more sounding in
the land. On a visit to Missouri, Walter Scott
met an eminent preacher, Moses E. Lard.</p>

<p>"You do not know me," said Lard, as he
threw his arm about the other; "but you are
the man who first taught me the Gospel."</p>

<p>"How so!" the other inquired.</p>

<p>"It was reading your book&mdash;'The Gospel
Restored,'" was the answer.</p>

<p>That is how this movement appeared to those
who came under its influence,&mdash;the Gospel
must be restored. The preachers proclaimed
and debated from the rostrum, and pulpit, and
on horseback. The laymen talked about it on
the street, and in the field, ready at any
moment to draw the Bible from their pockets
to show just what the "Old Jerusalem Gospel"
had to say for itself. The women discussed
regeneration and baptism over their sewing
and knitting. The children taunted each
other at school and at play, and the swaggering
bully might say to the despised "Campbellite,"
"<i>We</i> believe in a change of heart!"
or "<i>You</i> believe water will save you!"</p>

<p>Such taunts, however, did not assail the
young Carrs, for their parents belonged to no
church, and their grandparents and numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
relations were Presbyterians and Methodists.
Oliver's teacher, L. P. Streator, was a disciple
of Christ; his life, as well as that of Walter
Scott, were arguments, in their way, for the
"new religion"; but after all, Oliver had
thought little of religion during his first years
at the Academy. Martin Streator, his teacher's
son, persuaded him to attend the Sunday-school
at the Christian church; he went once
or twice, and then tried the Baptist Sunday-school
to find out what "they did over there".
The teacher of the Baptist class devoted his
hour to an explanation of the Holy Ghost,
which proved so baffling to the young mathematician,
that for some time thereafter he discharged
no religious duties.</p>

<p>Across the street from Carr's Hotel, was a
blacksmith shop. The smith was an Englishman,
Eneas Myall. Fifteen years before William
Carr drove from Lewis County in the old
barouche, Myall had come over from England,
and had stood on dry dock with only twenty-five
cents in his pocket. He walked twelve
miles to find work; needless to say, he found
it. He earned the passage-money from England
for his father, two brothers, and cousin.
All worked together; the cousin was a wagon-maker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and under the newly made wagon-wheels,
as they rested upon their trestles, were
the shavings that had curled up at the making.
In the cold dark mornings, when young Oliver
came down stairs to make his fires, the flames
leaped up from these very shavings, which he
had carried over the evening before. They
liked him at the shop, and Eneas, in particular,
believed he read an expression in the thin
face of the ambitious student, that promised
something better than a hotel life.</p>

<p>Eneas was a Christian; <a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>he and his two
brothers and his cousin had all heard the
Gospel preached by R. C. Ricketts, as they
had never heard it in the old country. Over
there, to escape the formalism of the Church of
England, they had listened to the Dissenters;
they had watched sinners hovering on the
Anxious-seat of the Presbyterians, and the
Mourning-bench of the Methodists. Such
ante-rooms to Grace were held indispensable.
As the eminent Congregationalist, Dr. Finney
explained, so nearly all believed: "The church
has always felt it necessary to have something
of this kind. In the days of the apostles baptism
answered this purpose. The Gospel was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
preached to the people and all who were willing
to be on Christ's side were called on to be
baptized. It held the precise place that the
anxious seat does now, as a public manifestation
of their determination to be Christians."</p>

<p>But Eneas and his relatives had been called
upon by the preacher, not to come to something
which served the same purpose as an institution
of old, but to the institution itself.
"Repent and be baptized every one of you in
the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of
sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy
Spirit!" This was the trumpet call of R. C.
Ricketts. To the simple blacksmith, it sounded
like a voice long silent, issuing from the
sacred past. He had never heard it proclaimed
before. He and his obeyed the call. Having
entered upon the Christian life, this blacksmith
felt an inexhaustible enthusiasm for the cause.
He had been made so happy by his acceptance
of what opponents called the "new religion"
that he wanted all his friends to partake of his
happiness. When W. T. Moore came to May's
Lick to raise funds for Bethany College, the
first college of the disciples,&mdash;Eneas took his
old rusty pen and wrote "$100."</p>

<p>Moore, in surprise, looked at the stalwart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
form in its rude garb, and then at the homely
scene in which it seemed in keeping. "This is
more than you ought to give!" he exclaimed.
"How do you make it?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said the blacksmith, casting the pen
aside, and lifting his hammer, "I beat it out
of this iron! It is such a good cause, I'm
sure I can give $100.00."</p>

<p>That was when Oliver was fifteen. W. T.
Moore was holding a meeting at the church,
working up the college endowment during the
day. One evening, when Oliver entered the
shop, as he did daily, seeking his kindling, Ed
Myall looked up from his work, and said,
"Ollie, isn't it time for you to be a Christian?"
He would have said more, but his voice failed
him. The boy, without a word, turned and
went away. It was the first time anyone had
ever spoken to him about being a Christian.
He had dropped out of the Sunday school; he
rarely attended church.</p>

<p>His sister Minnie was the first of the family
to become a Christian. She repented; she confessed
her faith; she was baptized; and then
she became a missionary, thus: She met Oliver
in the hall, as by accident&mdash;such matters come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
hard to the young and inexperienced&mdash;and said,
"Ol, I want you to be a good boy!"</p>

<p>That was all; but he knew what she meant.
The opportunity to go to church was not
wanting, for Mr. and Mrs. Carr were always
ready to take the work in hand for that purpose.
They wanted the children to go to
church, though, to be sure, they would have
preferred the churches of their fathers. So on
Sunday, Oliver went to church and heard W.
T. Moore preach the first sermon he had ever
understood. The same points were preached
over and over, "What must I do to be saved?"
And after that, when Oliver was driving passengers
to and fro, or hauling wheat to market,
he was thinking incessantly over what he had
heard, that question of old,&mdash;"What must I
do to be saved?" and then of the answer, as it
had come from the lips of Peter and Silas and
Paul. And he made the resolution, "Next
Sunday, I will do what I think right!"</p>

<p>He asked his father's permission to "join the
church." "If you know what you are doing,"
said William Carr, "go ahead."</p>

<p>Oliver thought he knew. The next Sunday
he did up his morning's work, then walked
to the Christian Church, where he made his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
confession of faith. It was a joyous occasion,
and few eyes were dry, as the lad stood up to
make known the new born desire of his heart.
There were no looks cast at him askance, no
chill of social cast. All felt one in Christ Jesus,
and there was nothing but love for the lad
from Lewis County.</p>

<p>And his mother who was by inheritance a
Methodist, said, "The Campbellites have got
Ollie!" He was baptized; of all his family, only
Minnie was present.</p>

<p>One afternoon Oliver, now sixteen, came
home for the last time from May's Lick Academy.
He had finished the course. He carried
his report proudly. "Seven" was the highest
mark according to the teacher's system. Oliver's
card was sprinkled all over with "7's."
As he drew near the tavern, he saw his father
in his chair, which had been brought outside.</p>

<p>He examined the report of his son with laudable
pride, then said, "Well, Ollie, you will
have to finish for yourself, now. I'm not
able to send you to school any longer."</p>

<p>Of course, there was plenty of hard work.
There was the wheat for him to haul across
the county to Maysville, and the loads of coal
to be brought home from the river; and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
were the passengers to be carried to and fro;
and, always, the home tasks.</p>

<p>But this life of crushed ambitions was not
long to continue. Soon after Oliver's admission
into the church, Eneas Myall, the blacksmith,
walked into Carr's Hotel, accompanied
by a prominent member of the church. Oliver
happened to be in the hall when they began
speaking to his father. He heard a few words,
and crept nearer the door, his heart leaping in
wild tumult.</p>

<p>He heard the blacksmith's voice, that voice
which had often cheered him as he went about
his daily tasks. And now it was asking if
William Carr would consent to Oliver's being
sent to Kentucky University at Harrodsburg;
saying that he and Dr. A. H. Wall would
pledge themselves to furnish the money. Is it
a wonder that to Oliver Carr, that voice
"sounded like sweetest music?"</p>

<p>William expressed his sorrow at not being
able to educate his children as he wished; he
appreciated the offer now made. "But," he
said, earnestly, "don't undertake this, unless
you are sure you can go on with it; I don't
want you to give him up!"</p>

<p>A few days later Eneas Myall came with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
hard-earned money, and placed it in Oliver's
hands, asking him to take it with the love of
its donors. And so, at the age of sixteen,
Oliver Carr went to the University at Harrodsburg,
to study for the ministry.</p>

<p>So, this is what we have found, in our quest
of a possible husband for Mattie Myers&mdash;this
Oliver Carr, who, as it appears, is far from
being a rich young man. Will brother Joe be
satisfied? Nay, will he ever consent? At any
rate, they must be brought together. Let us
return to the overworked pupil of John
Augustus Williams, she who parsed, in class,
too much of that MS. of his "Life of John
Smith" for her health. We shall find her still
upon her sick-bed, hovering between life and
death.</p>

<h3>A SCHOOL GIRL'S NOTE BOOK.</h3>


<p>Of course she recovered, else there need
be no biography of Mattie Myers, except
to teach young girls not to study
too hard&mdash;a lesson seldom needed.
But the life we are following is to
teach a quite different lesson. She emerges
from the sickroom with a constitution shattered;
not altogether broken, but much out of
repair every way; mentally, in particular; for
the mind has developed enormous energy in
proportion as the body has wasted away; and
all the nerves that are controlled from the general
office are sent tingling at the least noise&mdash;even
at the tread of a great thought.</p>

<p>The girl of sixteen is bewildered with herself.
That grasp of the will which had held her to
her tasks, to the outraging of her physical self,
has suddenly slipped&mdash;it cannot be tightened
up to the proper tension, at least not now.
This inability to sleep that has come upon her,
is to continue throughout her life; this nervous
excitement of vital forces, this disproportion of
mind and matter, this thinness of form, this
determination to carry self to the end marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
out, shown in the firm mouth&mdash;we are to find
all these unchanged in after years.</p>

<p>In the meantime, her resolution to carry on
her education has not faltered. She cannot go
back to Daughters' College&mdash;Professor Williams
does not know how to bear lightly upon
the mind, and the girl has not even yet learned
to spare herself. But there is a certain convent,
the St. Catherine de Sienna's&mdash;Joe will
send her there for a year. The very name is
restful. The course is such that a young girl
may carry it with one hand. Mattie will attend
a year; that will graduate her from the
St. Catherine de Sienna's. If, by that time,
her strength has come back, she may finish at
Harrodsburg. The convent will be so quiet&mdash;no
levees, no marching to church in solid-green,
no receptions in the parlors&mdash;nothing but trees
and birds and silent-footed sisters, and cool
gray walls, and a little French, a little ancient
history, and such portions of the Old Testament
history as have not become Protestantized.</p>

<p>Joe and Mattie discuss these plans at the
close of Joe's school-day, as they sit on his
piazza, his flute for the time silent. If they
ever considered her ability to go back to John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Augustus Williams instead of seeking the tutelage
of the saint, an event took place that rendered
such a course impossible. It was an
event that grew out of other events, all of
which had been preparing for many years.</p>

<p>To young Oliver Carr, far to the north in
Mason County, the beginning had been announced
by his old friend Walter Scott. It
had come about in this way:</p>

<p>One evening the almost-raven locks and the
keen but always kindly eyes, of Walter Scott
appeared at Carr's hotel, which is for the
nonce, the post office.</p>

<p>"Dear," he said to the youth who, for the
time, is deputy post master, "have you anything
for me this evening?"</p>

<p>Oliver, feeling that pleasure he always experienced
when this question could be affirmed
by a paper or letter, handed out the <i>Louisville
Courier</i>. The old man opened it, and caught
sight of words in large black letters that stared
from the top of the page. At the door he read
the line aloud:</p>

<div class='center'>
"<span class="smcap">Firing on Fort Sumpter!</span>"</div>

<p>The reader burst into tears, and sank down
upon the sidewalk. His friends hastened up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
thinking he was ill, but Walter Scott could
only say, as he pointed at the page,&mdash;"Oh, my
country is ruined!" They carried him to his
home, to that bed from which he was never to
rise. That was in April, 1861. On the 21st
he whispered his dying message to his friend
L. P. Streator, Oliver's teacher,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It has been my privilege to develop the
kingdom of God. I have been greatly honored".
On the 23rd, he was no more, for God
took him.</p>

<p>The war broke in all its fury upon "neutral"
Kentucky. It brought the mountain guerrillas
down on May's Lick with all their cruelty, all
their wanton destruction. Woe to the goodly
stores in William Carr's larder, the furniture
of the hotel, the splendid horses in the stables,
when they come shouting and cursing at his
door! John Augustus Williams is obliged to
close his Daughters' College and save his learning
for another day. The young ladies have
laid aside metaphysics and rhetoric to make
clothes for the boys fighting in the Carolinas.
For a time it seems not so important to classify
the metonymies as to make peas or dandelion
taste like coffee.</p>

<p>But gentle St. Catherine de Sienna raises its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
voice in pious song, and tolls its beads, and
murmurs in pensive recitivo "<i>Je suis</i>, <i>tu es</i>, <i>il
est</i>, <i>elle est</i>"&mdash;and hears not the echo of Perryville
cannon, as one hears in Harrodsburg;
or, if hearing, puts it to the account of the flesh
and the devil, and chants <i>Te deum laudamus</i>.</p>

<p>Mattie's year in the convent is of all things
the one needful. She rests and learns. At
the end of the year she knows what St. Catherine
de Sienna had to teach, and her strength
is no worse from the acquisition. But as for
any influence upon her mind or heart by this
year's experience, we seek in vain for a trace.
It may be that the beliefs she took behind the
convent walls were made firmer to resist soft
influences; or it may be that her faith was so
impregnable at the beginning of this gentle
eclipse, that it had nothing to fear.</p>

<p>The girl of seventeen bade farewell to St.
Catherine's with the warm affection of the girl,
and the serene self-poise of the woman. It left
her just where it had found her, except that
she knew a little more about the light graces
of learning, and&mdash;the main thing, after all,&mdash;that
she was now able to go on with serious
study. It is often the case, when a Protestant
so young as Mattie, graduates from the convent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
that she carries through life a little cloistered
chamber in her heart, where thoughts
slip in the quiet hour to count their beads, and
whisper "Ave Maria".</p>

<p>The next year Mattie returned to Daughters'
College, where she graduated with honors, in
1865. There is an old gray-mottled composition-book
written through in different inks,
the prevailing color suggesting iron-rust, the
pages showing the shadows of half a century,
and the oft-repeated contact of a school-girl's
hand. We find on the title page, "Miss Mattie
Forbes Myers," written by her own hand&mdash;that
was when she was thirteen. Later&mdash;for
this book was used during her college days&mdash;we
find "Mattie F. Myers"&mdash;no use now, for
her to prefix the "Miss;" that is done by
others.</p>

<p>This book is filled with notes taken at lectures,
with poems, some original and some
copied or memorized, with essays, with school
notes; and here alone, save in a few essays on
separate sheets, are we given a glimpse into the
girl's mind, by the girl herself. Here we may
find what she thought of life and death and
immortality&mdash;but nothing of her daily life.</p>

<p>The book is interesting because of its omissions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
There are no straggling lines such as
one naturally writes in one's school-days when it
is raining, for instance; or when one feels dull or
impatient for the closing hour. There are no
pyramids of schoolmates' names, no idle pictures
that might be faces or geometrical figures,
no allusions to Harrodsburg, or Lancaster, or
Stanford, or any place or person more concrete
than Moses crossing the Red Sea, or Hannibal
crossing the Alps. Above all, in whatever disquisition
upon the "Atonement" or "The
Johnsonian Era," there is no flash of humor.
One cannot avoid the impression in turning
over these 209 closely written pages that here
was a girl who, from year to year&mdash;that is, from
twelve to twenty,&mdash;was serious, was intent
upon a definite plan, was adhering closely to a
central theme, unmindful of aught that detracts
or turns the mind aside, though that
digression be but the pleasant recreation of a
smile.</p>

<p>It is true that all these pages do not present
"solid reading matter." There is poetry here
which shows a deeper love of poetry than of a
poetic gift. One sees that this love of poetry
was no superficial acquirement; it was not that
nice taste for forms that contents the modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
reader of magazines with a four-line stanza
about any subject that can be put into four
lines. Mattie read Mrs. Browning because she
loved her. Of all books in English literature,
she seems to have cared most for "Aurora
Leigh." We find her in after years advising
her friends to read Mrs. Browning, if they
would taste the purest literary joys. A serious
business, indeed, was life to that great-souled
English poet with the slender hand up-propping
the heavy head&mdash;this life so full of song
and gaiety to most of us, before we stop laughing&mdash;also
it meant serious business to Mattie
Myers. And as Elizabeth Barrett found in
later years a great love upon which she could
always rest her weary heart, even so was Mattie
Myers to find a love resourceful and deathless?
We shall see, by-and-by.</p>

<p>The first writing in the book&mdash;written somewhere
in her thirteenth year, is this: "A forehead
royal with the truth"&mdash;<i>Elizabeth Barrett
Browning</i>. Then we find, "As stars
differ from one another in glory, so shall it be
in the resurrection morn." Later comes,
"Heaven is fair, earth pitiless; why is life so
dear?" And, "He who has most of heart has
most of sword." Then, "Oh life, is all thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
song, Endure and die?" These are interesting
as showing what sort of sentiments interested
the little girl at the boarding-school.
They are all like these, her written selections,
grave to solemnity. Her original poetry is like
it:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i2">"In this narrow vale of life<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Amid its scoldings and its strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Amid its darkness and its gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Loving children, welcome, come."</span>
</div>

<p>Nor was this that seriousness which many
an author confines to his writings, living a life
far different from one's tragic numbers. Mattie
was not an author, she had no desire to be
one, and what she wrote was not apart from
her life, but a part of it.</p>

<p>The style she developed was the oratorical.
Her sentences were balanced, and her thoughts
enforced by repetition. What she wrote after
her graduation was, in the main, written to be
delivered in public address. Her college theses
represent the highest development of her style.
Even as one reads them, he feels that they
should be proclaimed. They are suited to the
public platform. If the girl who wrote these
does not, in time, become a popular lecturer,
we shall be much mistaken! Moreover, apart
from the embellishment which she loved to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
her sentences, we find that whatever subject
she undertakes, she treats with a whole-souled
enthusiasm, as if it were a matter of immediate,
vital importance, and as if she were an eyewitness
of the event. Hear her:</p>

<p>"But when Aurora with her rosy fingers
lifted the veil of night and robed the earth in
sparkling gems, the predominant trait of his
character again swayed his being, and again his
solemn oath was violated. Infatuated man!
Think you that because the stream now flows
smoothly, and the thunder of the cataract has
transiently ceased, that you are far removed
from danger? Already you are within the
rapids." Who is this man that is in such terrible
danger? None other than our old friend
Pharaoh. In such thrilling words is his doom
presently presented, that we feel that while he
got no worse than he deserved, still it was
enough. This was written at St. Catherine's.
She is just as intimate with, just as keenly
alive to, the sorrows of Spenser:</p>

<p>"Though the ashes of Spenser repose at
Westminister, yet he still lives in the hearts of
every lover of the beautiful and the good. The
casket has decayed, but the jewel is firmly set
in the coronet of Literature. There it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
shine in undimmed splendor and beauty until
the Empire of Genius shall fall. Even in our
school-girl heart he has found a place, and
memory of his woes and his joys, of his poverty
and his unsearchable riches, will be with us
forever."</p>

<p>The same spirit of bringing heart and soul
into the theme, is shown in her treatment of her
favorites of the Elizabethan era, the time of
Queen Anne, or the Fall of Carthage. One
does not feel that these essays are "pieces" so
much as they are fragments of a sincere and
enthusiastic mind. That which rouses her to
greatest exaltation is the description of a soul
encountering supreme difficulties; and we find
her standing by Hannibal with a trumpet call
to duty and heroism, when all his own have
deserted him. Here is her hero of history, to
none other does she so freely pour forth the
unstinted admiration of her girl's heart.</p>

<p>Two other qualities should be mentioned in
this connection. One is the intellectual force
shown in these really remarkable productions,
the ability to take the accepted positions of
critics and clothe them in new and pulsing
words. No need to ask for help in writing
these compositions! who indeed could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
done so well? In a few instances we find where
the pencil of John Augustus Williams has
culled out superlative phrases, or where he
has inquired (for instance, after such a phrase
as "we weep for him") if this is not rather
"strong?" But on the whole, he leaves her
articles unchanged, doubtless taking keen delight
in the ability that has produced them. A
young girl who can write thus at fifteen and
seventeen, might do great things as an author;
but as we have seen, her plans were formed for
other fields.</p>

<p>The last quality of her writings which we
have reserved, is one that permeates everything
she wrote. No matter what the subject&mdash;whether
the "Vail of Wyoming," or the general
title, "Logic"&mdash;religion comes in; we do
not say it creeps in; it walks in with head erect.
It quite often overflows and submerges the
point under consideration. One feels at times
that the subject has been a means of getting
at more vital matters. All through the composition-book
we find pieces of sermons, and
quotations of moral reflections, and verses
from the Bible. Here and there are penciled
little prayers such as a school girl might make
who has deep purposes. There are pages of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
reflections on the Holy Spirit, side by side with
French lessons. The religious nature of man;
Christ as Prophet; Christ as Law-giver; God
and Justice; Faith&mdash;these are discussed at
length between sections of Botany notes and
Geology and Civil Government classifications.
The last word of all is given, not to a remark
about some seatmate, or teacher, but to John
the Baptist&mdash;what she thought of <i>his</i> life and
purpose.</p>

<p>In this schoolbook, closed so long ago, there
is a page almost filled with a discussion of Lady
Macbeth; then, inverted lines, penciled as if to
stow it away from conspicuous sight&mdash;and, indeed,
against the background of iron-rusted
ink, it is hardly discernible&mdash;are these lines
without a subject heading: "God grant that
I may never find enjoyment in the foolish
pleasures of the world; but that my soul may
soar far above its ephemeral joys unto the unsearchable
riches of Christ Jesus my Lord."</p>

<p>That was the prayer of her young days; it
explains what she has written&mdash;the pages we
have been examining. By the light of this
prayer, we may follow her from the schoolroom
to her active service in the outer world. We
see her attentive upon the worship of God;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
not only going, but leading; not only listening,
but ministering. She finds her work in the
songs of the church. At Mount Carmel lives
her married sister, Mrs. Kate O'Bannon, a devoted
member of the Church of Christ. During
her latter summer vacations, Mattie stays
with her; at church, she leads the singing.</p>

<p>In the early mornings, Mattie delighted in
her walk along the ridge-road, from which the
woods could be heard speaking in the myriad
voices of bird-happiness. And she loved the
little church, fresh from her school-duties,
loved each greeting at the sunny door, and
down the quiet aisles, coming as voices from
long voyages apart. She led the singing with
all her heart, and the congregation sang with
all theirs; and when a protracted meeting was
to be held, there was pleasurable excitement
among the singers, over what to sing, and how
to sing it.</p>

<p>One day, excitement is rife among church-members;
one hears that a strange preacher is
coming to hold a meeting&mdash;a young man Mattie
has never seen. Who can it be? Surely
not the boy from May's Lick? Surely not the
Oliver Carr who was startled one evening with
an armful of shavings, poised for bearing home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
at hearing the wagon-maker say&mdash;"Ollie, isn't
it time for you to be a Christian?"</p>

<p>Certainly, it would be strange if Oliver Carr
should come to preach in the church where
Mattie Myers leads the singing! The hard-earned
money of Eneas Myall and his friend
would not have been spent in vain, should such
be the case! Let us return to May's Lick at
the time of Oliver's starting to college, and find
how, by any means, we can bring him to Mount
Carmel to hold this very meeting, for which
"Miss Mattie" is making ready.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>A UNIVERSITY STUDENT.</h3>


<p>That was a wonderful day for the
boy Oliver when, with the farewells of
his parents, brothers and sisters,
friends and benefactors, ringing in
his ears, he started to college. As
the stage coach rushed across the corner of
Fleming County, and plunged through Nicholas
and wound its way among the bluegrass
pasture lands of Bourbon, he felt that he was
seeing the world, at last; and not only seeing
the world, but had the means to take an honored
place in it; for to this youth of sixteen,
there seemed no honor greater than that of
preaching the Gospel.</p>

<p>It was so plain to him, this plea of the disciples
of Christ; it appeared so evidently the truth of
the whole matter; he was anxious to tell others
about it, imagining in his inexperienced zeal,
that others would be as glad to hear as he had
been. But before he could preach, the collegiate
fortresses of wisdom must be stormed
and captured. Head of his class in mathematics
at the academy&mdash;that is the best we can
say for him now, and souls are not won from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
sin and error by the demonstrations of Euclid.</p>

<p>Here we are in Fayette County, and the train
stops at Lexington. Here Oliver pauses, but
does not stop, for the University is wanting
several years of reaching this point. We must
hold on our course&mdash;down through Jessamine
County to Mercer. And now indeed, our blood
thrills as if needles were pricking our veins, for
we are near our destination,&mdash;near Harrodsburg
the goal of our boyhood's ambition.</p>

<p>There are other boys in the stage coach going
to the University, and we talk about the
history of that institution, and of its professors,
and of what we will do when we stop at
the station, and where we will go,&mdash;all strangers
as we are, and all young, in this year, 1861.</p>

<p>Some one tells how Bacon College was established
by the disciples of Christ in Georgetown
twenty-five years ago, and how its first president
was Walter Scott&mdash;a name sufficient to
bring up May's Lick before Oliver's mind,
with a far-away suggestion of homesickness.</p>

<p>And another tells (or should tell for the
refreshing of the reader's memory) of ten years
of college life under James Shannon, until Bacon
College went to sleep, or underwent suspended
animation, and had to be brought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Harrodsburg by J. B. Bowman, to try what a
new climate and a new name could do for it.
So Bacon College became Kentucky University
in 1858&mdash;just three years ago.</p>

<p>Then another&mdash;for there were four of these<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
boys, and being boys they talked a great deal,
and, as we see, very much to our purpose&mdash;congratulates
all upon the fortunate circumstances
that have provided the University with
the first teachers of the land&mdash;a fortunate circumstance
for Harrodsburg, he means; of
course a fortunate circumstance for anybody
has a curious way of being unfortunate so far
as somebody else is concerned.</p>

<p>Bethany College had been reduced to ashes;
and although new walls were starting up from
the gray ruins, such men of learning and piety
as Bethany College boasted could not sit idly
by, while brick was laid upon brick; they, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
might be building, and, by happy fortune,
something more durable than stone. So Robert
Milligan leaves his chair of mathematics
at Bethany, to assume the presidency of our
reawakened or newborn institution&mdash;old Bacon
College, or new Kentucky University&mdash;one
hardly knows if the author was Bacon or
Shakespeare!&mdash;and Dr. Robt. Richardson entrusts
his chair of Physical Science at Bethany
to Dr. H. Christopher, and becomes vice-president
at Harrodsburg. So now we know&mdash;by
listening to the chatter of these prospective
students&mdash;how it came about that Mattie
Myers was treated to the preaching of these
giants. She is over yonder at Daughters' College
even now a girl of fourteen. Even then,
she says, she "had given her life to serious
study and preparation for her chosen life-work."</p>

<p>And what of Bethany College? How can it
survive the loss of those illustrious men? Perhaps
with its Alexander Campbell for president,
it can weather the gale!</p>

<p>But certainly those of us who are Kentuckians
and who have been attending the College
in Virginia, because we had none of our own,
now feel unbounded elation over our newly-captured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
prize! For in those days, says S. W.
Crutcher, who was just such a student, "We
had somehow gotten into the habit of spelling
Kentucky with a big 'K' and the United States
in small letters."</p>

<p>It was Crutcher who, then in Virginia, went
with the other Kentuckians to "Hybernia" to
congratulate Professor Milligan on being chosen
president of Kentucky University. The Professor&mdash;who
had already grown cautious about
standing in draughts&mdash;expressed his resolution
to spend the remainder of his life in the service of
the University; and Mrs. Milligan, with thoughts
for the present life, led the young men into the
dining-room. Belle is in short dresses; for, as
we have said, this was three years ago; and it
is only last year that Robt. Graham left Harrodsburg
for Arkansas.</p>

<p>We were speaking of S. W. Crutcher; and by
a queer coincidence, there he is in the middle of
the street as the stage coach brings Oliver Carr
to Harrodsburg. We are here at last. Crutcher
takes Oliver and his three traveling-companions
to a boarding-house which proves an undesirable
place, and President Milligan takes Oliver
into his own home; there he finds Belle's dress
three years nearer the floor than when Sam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Crutcher told her farewell in Bethany; and Oliver
is, of course, very much afraid of her; for
was there ever a boy more awkward or more
conscious of his tallness and thinness, than this
youth from Lewis and Mason County?</p>

<p>Perhaps not. But he is much at ease with
the president, himself, for the president is a
man&mdash;and Oliver has dealt thus far principally
with men&mdash;and not only so, but with a prince
of men. If Eneas Myall, the blacksmith, could
have had the choosing of Oliver's companions,
knowing in his practical English head that his
protege was in the danger-zone of youth, when
companionship counts most&mdash;he could have selected
with no greater care than Providence
seemed to have done.</p>

<p>First of all, there was the Milligan household
with its atmosphere as unlike that of the village
hotel, as if it had been of another world.
Then there was the man with whom Oliver
used to walk home from school, with whom he
loved to stroll in the twilight&mdash;the Professor of
English, who examined the youth's fitness for
his junior year by having him analyze and parse
a hymn. Between this man and boy grew a
liking that was soon ardent love. "My boy"&mdash;that
is what L. L. Pinkerton called Oliver.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
And Oliver, as he walked with his favorite
teacher, and heard him quote poetry&mdash;poetry
in the balmy evenings of autumn, poetry in the
crisp winter afternoon, poetry wherever Pinkerton
was, whether that of others, or that of his
own joyous temperament&mdash;here was another
formative influence for the boy from the froglands.</p>

<p>When we, of another day, look back upon
that time, and watch this sweet association, it
is hard to understand the bitterness&mdash;we must
not say hatred&mdash;that used to be roused at the
mention of the Professor of English. Let us
take a closer look at this man from Baltimore
County, Maryland; a brief look, necessarily,
but one which will seek to envelope his main
attributes. In so doing, we have not forgotten
that our central aim is to present the life of
Mattie Myers over yonder in Daughters' College&mdash;where
she has scarcely heard of Oliver Carr,
though she knows Pinkerton by sight.</p>

<p>To begin at the beginning of L. L. Pinkerton's
life&mdash;which was in his eighteenth year&mdash;we
find him building a post-and-rail fence in
West Virginia not far from Bethany;
"black locust posts, black walnut rails," he
remembers, "all taken from the stump, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
fence set, for twenty-five cents per panel of
eight feet." Not that the quality of wood or
price of wages matters&mdash;at least now; what
does matter is that one morning, before going
to work, he found a paper on the table, edited
by Alexander Campbell. The <i>Millennial
Harbinger</i> was its name. Lewis picked up the
paper casually, and was soon reading with
strange intentness&mdash;reading and re-reading.
Strange reading-matter to absorb the attention
of a fence-builder of eighteen&mdash;it was all
about Truth! Presently he went to Bethany to
hear more about it, and at the close of a sermon
by A. Campbell, was baptized&mdash;he rode
home that night four miles in dripping garments.
It was so wonderful to him, this plea
of the disciples of Christ&mdash;one name for all
Christendom, one rule of faith and practice,
and that rule the Bible alone&mdash;he could not
but believe that it would be eagerly accepted
by a sect-divided world! He began preaching.</p>

<p>From Lexington he went to Midway, where
he established the Orphan School of the Christian
church. For sixteen years he labored in
raising funds, and in teaching, for this exponent
of practical Christianity. The same enthusiasm
which had marked his acceptance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the "reformed religion" carried him over innumerable
obstacles, whether of miserliness,
poverty, or cold discouragement. Now the
Midway Orphan School was firmly established,
and the year before Oliver came to the University,
Pinkerton accepted the English professorship.</p>

<p>But, unfortunately for his peace of mind,
however fortunate for truth in the abstract
and concrete, poetry was not the only thing
that L. L. Pinkerton talked, outside of school
hours. When we seek to pierce the clouds of
misunderstanding and accusation that darken
the atmosphere of those days, the charges of
heresy, and the retorts of sectarianism, above
all, the trumpet call that one or the other was
not "sound,"&mdash;which opprobrious epithet, indeed,
sounds above all the other jarring cries,&mdash;we
cannot believe that this resolution to
"down Pinkerton" came from the sole desire
to exalt the Christ. No doubt his opposers
believed such to be the case, but they were
mistaken. It was all the war, the spirit of the
times. Though the heavens fall, Pinkerton
must proclaim his conviction that slavery was
of the devil, must lecture about it, must do
everything that lay in his power to convince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
others, must declare his satisfaction when Lincoln's
Proclamation&mdash;that one proclamation
that calls for no explanatory data to remind
one <i>what</i> proclamation&mdash;outraged those who
did not believe slavery to be of the devil; far
otherwise, indeed.</p>

<p>For the war has burst upon us, now in all
its fury, and though we, as a state, are "neutral,"
everybody knows what that means, and
suspects his neighbor accordingly. In Midway,
Pinkerton in building up the church, established
and nurtured a church for the black folk&mdash;preached
for it until out of African darkness
was evolved a light to shine for itself. He believed
these slaves had souls, and somehow, he
looked upon his labors for their salvation as a
part of the practical good-doing that flowered
in the Orphan School. If he could only believe
these things to himself, and not say anything!
But in that case, he would not have been
Pinkerton. And so, after the year 1862&mdash;the
year in which Oliver Carr preached his first
sermon&mdash;no church-door was opened that
L. L. Pinkerton might preach therein&mdash;never
again was he to be thought "sound" enough.</p>

<p>Oliver heard much of "soundness" in those
days, just as we do now. But happily for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
peace of mind, he was not disturbed by the
continuous jarring and clashing of orthodox
and heretical opinions. He was too busy&mdash;too
busy, almost to eat; there is no recreation
for him save as he trudges to and fro between
school and lodgings, with, or without,
the poetical friend. For he is most irregular in
his classes; mathematics&mdash;fine; Latin and
Greek&mdash;nothing!&mdash;"Dead," his father had objected.
Dead indeed, and buried so deep, that
the boy must dig hard and late, to unearth
the skeletons. The result of which exhausting
excavation we hear announced in the language
of Dr. Richardson: "If you don't improve in
health I do not see how you can continue your
studies&mdash;" And, a little later: "You had
better go home!"</p>

<p>Dark days&mdash;a weary struggle for health&mdash;a
conviction that this is consumption&mdash;a last
futile fight for victory&mdash;back home goes the
broken invalid, just as Mattie Myers had been
forced to quit the field.</p>

<p>But there is a difference, since Oliver is
obliged to stop in the midst of everything&mdash;and
since he can ill afford a rest. He has had
his chance and it seems all in vain. For three
months he stays with his sister drinking mineral-water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
filled with torturing regrets and inextinguishable
hope. His sister&mdash;it is Mary&mdash;has
married; we are to hear of her again.
Three months&mdash;and he realizes that if he goes
back, it will mean as severe a regime as before.
The ground is hardly broken above those dead
languages, and he has not the strength he had
thought he possessed. However, if we could,
later on, take a peep at the young men about
the grounds, we would find Oliver Carr holding
his own with Surber, Keith and Mountjoy
and Albert Myles. For six years we find him
studying&mdash;"as hard as anybody," in his
opinion; but not again is ill-health to drive him
home, though always hovering at his elbow.
Let us take glimpses, here and there, at these
years, with the happy privilege of the reader,
of attending the school of his hero without being
compelled to study his hero's lessons.</p>

<p>At the close of his full year he goes back to
May's Lick. To rest? Yes, if to do what lies
closest to the heart is rest. He borrows a
horse, gets his saddlebags, arms himself with
Bible and hymn-book, and starts out for Carter
county where Henry Pangburn and Thomas
Munnell have "started a meeting." He informs
the girl who keeps the tollgate that he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
a preacher; no doubt in this boy's mind as to
what he is! He loses his way in the mountain
trails&mdash;"Babe" will go to show him the school-house,
if he will catch her old white horse with
burrs in its tail; "Babe" is a young lady of
two hundred pounds&mdash;what matter her other
name? On they go, in and out among the hills&mdash;Babe's
girth breaks and Oliver gives up his
horse to her.</p>

<p>"Hello Babe!" thus the father of Frank
Kibbey from his doorway, "who's that you
have with you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a little rebel I picked up on the way!"&mdash;a
laughing matter to Babe, but not to Oliver,
for he sees her drawn aside, and hears the
whispered demand, "<i>Is</i> he a rebel?"&mdash;and wonders
if he will be hung.</p>

<p>But they are all rebels together. Thomas
Munnell says "Ollie, you must preach tonight!"
And Oliver knows off-hand what he
will preach, because he has only one sermon! So
the benches are brought into the home of "Bro.
Kibbey"&mdash;for in the morning the preaching
had been in the woods,&mdash;and Oliver stood in a
corner, the preacher's point of vantage in those
days, and preached. "And some old women
bragged on me," he said afterward.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>These fledgling students&mdash;Kibbey and Carr&mdash;sent
an appointment to preach in the mountains.
As they rode along, talking about their
faith,&mdash;for that is what these boys loved to
talk about&mdash;they saw a beautiful pool sparkling
among lordly oaks, and they said, "Here is
where we will baptize!" Why not? Not a
word had been preached, nor had they ever
looked upon the faces of their prospective auditors;
but did they not have the truth? So
they preached to the mountaineers; and presently
came back to the pool among the oaks,
where they baptized four young men and four
young women.</p>

<p>Another picture, brief, almost brusque in its
bold coloring: the young man is called into the
office of the Professor of Mathematics, Henry
H. White. The teacher abruptly extends his
hand, "This is for you; take it."</p>

<p>It is fifty dollars. Oliver, the tears springing
to his eyes, would falter his thanks. "That
will do sir!" says the Professor with mathematical
dryness. "That will do sir! you're
dismissed,"&mdash;so sharply, so conclusively, that
nothing is to be done but go. There are two
such scenes, precisely alike; fifty dollars each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
time, and, "That will do sir!" as an end to
the incident.</p>

<p>Never were such kindnesses more gratefully
received, or more sorely needed. For men
have come down from the mountains, seizing
upon the property of Southern sympathizers,
and none too particular about your sympathies,
if they can get away with horses and money.
William Carr sees his hard-earned savings disappear
in a night. The horses from his stables
are spirited away; his hotel is looted; nor is
there wanting the suspicion that some of his
neighbors have pointed out the spoils to the
enemy. To his sudden necessity is added the
bitterness against injustice and ingratitude.
Farther into the night his wife must sew,
earlier in the morning they must rise; for
though one son is away at college, and one
daughter is married, there is little left to support
the other five children. So here at May's
Lick is a battle for daily bread, while Oliver,
at Harrodsburg, battles for daily Latin and
Greek.</p>

<p>Nor is this time of stress without its element
of heroism. One might pause in the narrative
to show the young University student in danger
of his life, on the occasion of one of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
home-comings. A drunken soldier, having
robbed William Carr of his horse, is about to
shoot the hotel-keeper because he is a "Southerner."
Oliver leaps between, fastens his gaze
upon the infuriated face, holds out his defenceless
arms, and saves his father's life.</p>

<p>This is Oliver's experience of the war, this
crushing blow upon his parents; this, and the
booming of cannon at Perryville, and the long
line of stragglers coming back from a beaten
field; and then the wounded and the dead.
Harrodsburg is taxed to the utmost in giving
shelter to the fallen heroes. Daughters' College
from which, as we have seen, the young
ladies have been banished, is opened up as a
hospital.</p>

<p>L. L. Pinkerton is no longer teaching; he
has resigned to become surgeon in the Eleventh
Kentucky Cavalry; just as he marched to the
defense of orphan girls and negroes groping in
spiritual darkness, so now he sallies forth for
his country; leading the soldiers in prayer every
evening, dressing the wounds of the blue or
gray, and singing Northern battle hymns.
And just as he always worked too hard for
Midway Orphan School, or for the disciples'
plea, or whatever he worked at&mdash;never resting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
till failing resources made him rest,&mdash;so now,
he toils at regimental prayer-meeting and midnight
diagnoses and presently finds himself
bedfast. Too feeble to stand, he lies praying
that the South may be conquered; and, so
praying, he is carried to the home of an old
friend, a Captain Carr, who is a Southerner to
the core.</p>

<p>For weeks the friend of Lincoln lies at the
point of death, cared for with all tenderness by
the friend of Jefferson Davis. Then J. B.
Bowman, he who turned Bacon College into
Kentucky University, came up from Harrodsburg
to Louisville; here the Professor of
English lay, and, taking him in his strong
arms, Bowman carried him out to the carriage
and rode away with him. So, we have him
back at Harrodsburg at last, where he may
walk with Oliver again, and quote poetry. Of
course he tells Oliver about his kind treatment
in the home of Captain Carr, and speaks of
the tender and faithful ministrations of Southern
nurses. And then, quickly, lest he be misunderstood,
he asserts his unalterable faith in
the justice of the Union cause; he will have no
doubts as to where he stands.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"I could scatter flowers over the graves of
the Confederate dead," he says, "and even bedew
them with my tears; but I must still say,
if forced to it, 'These poor, brave young men
fell in an unrighteous war against a beneficent
government!'" He must still say it, later on,
to the destruction of his peace of mind; to the
dissolution of many a friendly tie; must still say
it, if forced to it; and must say it, whether
forced or not, such being the impetuosity of his
character, which consumes prudence and policy
in one blaze of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Oliver is at war in his own
way. That the South should prove its right
to self-government appeared to him self-evident,
but it did not rouse his fighting blood. Souls
to be saved from sin and error&mdash;that is his
ever-pressing consideration. That all religious
bodies should take the name of Christian, and
worship according to the Scriptures&mdash;could
anything be simpler? That the six or seven
denominations in small tows, instead of utilizing
half their vitality in keeping themselves
going, should all combine in one glorious purpose
to exalt the Christ&mdash;could anything be
more like Heaven on Earth? Oliver thought
thus. He believed it might come to pass; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
he was eager to do his part in bringing it about.
So every summer he left the University halls to
carry his message into the hills and valleys of
Kentucky; and such was his youthful ardor,
his enthusiastic conviction of success, that people
for a time stopped talking about John Morgan
and friends in Canada, and went to hear
the boy from the village tavern.</p>

<p>The time came when he resolved to carry the
war into his own country. So he packed his
saddlebags and rode into the land of his youth.
There was no building of the disciples of Christ,
but Oliver was offered the Methodist meeting house.</p>

<p>When it was noised abroad that Oliver Carr
was going to preach, hearts were stirred and
the farmers, many miles away, began catching
up their horses to take the family to meeting.
Men who had not been to church for years
expressed themselves to this effect: "Ol going
to preach? Yes, I'll go to hear <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>The meeting began Thursday night; on
Saturday he baptized fourteen. Sunday morning
the church building was locked; an agitated
congregation hovered in the yard. "Oliver
has opened the doors of the church!" complained
his aunt&mdash;meaning the spiritual church;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
she had taken care that the church of pine
boards should be more closely guarded. Across
the street from the inhospitable meeting house
stood the school house. The audience moved
thither. The women went within; the men
remained outside. Oliver stood in the door,
and preached on "Christian Union".</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Bannon was there, she and her
school-girl sister, Mattie Myers. And Mattie
led the singing, and listened to the young University
student with unqualified approval. In
after days she was to hear him preach many a
sermon, and in many lands; "But that was the
best sermon he ever preached!" she declared.
For they were both so young, then, and both
so fired with zeal for the same cause which to
them seemed the supreme cause of earth and
heaven. And they were both so confident that
this cause must triumph&mdash;perhaps in their own
lifetime!</p>

<p>Oliver went to Orangeburg to preach in another
Methodist church, and people came from
May's Lick to hear the boy, his father among
the number. Very seldom, if ever, had Oliver
seen William Carr at church before; here he
baptized fourteen&mdash;but alas! his father was not
one of them. Then ten days at Sardis, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
forty baptized&mdash;but we need not follow the
youth from point to point; it was everywhere
the same indestructible faith, and many converts,
and the beginnings of church life.</p>

<p>Daniel Carr, Oliver's grandfather, sent for
him to come up to Lewis county and preach in
his home. Daniel was a prominent class-leader
of the Methodist church, 76 years old. Oliver
responded gladly, entered the county of his
birth, where his uncles and aunts all lived,
faithful Methodists. His grandfather brought
benches and chairs into his house, and called in
neighbors and kinsfolk. Oliver saw before
him the boys and girls with whom he had gone
to school in the country before his father's removal
to May's Lick. Here were Old-School
Baptists and Presbyterians, come to hear what
the "Campbellite" had to tell them. But
they did not come in hostility; far from that.
It was with wonder, rather, that they looked
upon this young man and thought of his past&mdash;the
hard work on the farm, the harder work
in his father's hotel. They knew how he had
been obliged to leave the University on account
of ill-health, and how, since then, he had taxed
his strength to the utmost in evangelistic campaigns
among the hills. And now he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
come to them, his old neighbors, to tell them
about Christ!</p>

<p>His grandfather knelt down to open the
meeting with prayer, but suddenly the wonder
and the joy of it came upon him, and they
heard nothing but his sobs. When he was
able to utter words, they burst from a heart
that throbbed with heavenly thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Then Oliver rose. At last, at last! the privilege
was his to speak to these dear people,
words of eternal life. As he looked into their
kindly faces, he too, was overcome by emotion.
Minute after minute passed by, and he could
but weep, while the faces of his audience, bathed
in tears, told him that the yearning of his heart
was understood. It seems wonderful when a
celebrated man rises to address an audience,
and, for ten minutes, stands dumb before tireless
applause. But what shall we say of this
boy who stands ten minutes unable to speak
for tears of joy, while his friends wait, unable
to hear for weeping?</p>

<p>This we must say; that we have found here
a youth who has given himself with all his soul
to an idea; an idea that grips at the roots of
emotions and desires and life itself. Will not
he who weeps with joy at the opportunity to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
deliver his message, also fight for it? But
though fighting, will not his valor be tempered
with the tenderness of tears?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>LOVE AND SACRIFICE.</h3>


<p>So they have met at last, the preacher
and the singer. They might have
finished their education there at Harrodsburg,
Oliver Carr at the University
and Mattie Myers at Daughters'
College&mdash;if the meeting had not brought them
together&mdash;who knows! But, being brought
together in that way, and being the grave and
purposeful characters we have found them to
be, it is easy enough to comprehend the friendship
that came into being; a friendship sanctified,
as it were, by the sound of hymn and the
fervor of prayer.</p>

<p>After the services we find Oliver going home
with Mrs. O'Bannon, in whose parlor he meets
the school-girl sister. Serious enough is their
talk&mdash;you might have thought them staid
Christians of middle life! She finds him awkward
and embarrassed, except when the talk
runs religiously. He finds her, to his thinking,
highly educated, and feels due awe for her
superior advantages. Behold him, now, driving
up with a spring-wagon to take Mattie
and her friends on an excursion to the mineral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
springs&mdash;"sculapia", it is called&mdash;certainly
an appropriate spot for these two health-needing
students! Drink of that mineral-water
as deeply as you may and let us hope Old
sculapius himself will infuse strength into the
sparkling drops!</p>

<p>After this pleasant companionship, Oliver
and Mattie were never again to be strangers.
Now he knows one girl at Daughters' College
who leads singing in the church&mdash;and she
knows one young man at the University whose
very soul is wrapped up in the things nearest
her own heart. He comes to the college to
see her; and John Augustus Williams sits with
them in the parlor to complete the triangle,&mdash;very
properly; are not triangles the least-sided
figures known in the halls of learning? And
when President Milligan gives a levee, who
comes for Mattie to escort her thither? Ask if
you choose; I shall not answer!</p>

<p>We have seen how Kentucky University
emerged from Bacon College, but we have not
witnessed the closing scene of the transformation.
Out of Georgetown came Bacon College
to Harrodsburg; and out of Danville came
Transylvania Seminary to Lexington; here the
Seminary found Kentucky Academy, and these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
two were fused into Transylvania University.
For sixty-six years Transylvania University
flourished and then declined. Then fire destroyed
the college building at Harrodsburg,
and Milligan came to Lexington, and Kentucky
University was amalgamated with old
Transylvania, and these two were one. Which
takes Oliver away from Harrodsburg, and that
means letters; letters between him and Mattie
Myers.</p>

<p>It was in 1865 that Kentucky University
gave its last exercises in Harrodsburg. The
"Franklin Literary and Philosophical Society"
gave its "exhibit," June 21st. From his
"speeches" written out and now among the
relics it appears that Oliver was usually chosen
to represent the "Franklins." One subject
discussed was, "Should we in the administration
of law, be influenced by Justice alone?"
J. T. Spillman of Harrodsburg affirms; O. A.
Carr of May's Lick denies. And the speech
that O. A. Carr delivers is sent on eight pages,
the words liberally italicised, to "Miss
Mattie." "I do this to gratify my friend," he
adds at the end of the poetry that closes the
debate, "and I hope that she will not forget her
promise&mdash;I will expect those notes on President<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Williams' lecture soon." Thus begins the
correspondence: a debate from him, lecture
notes from her.</p>

<p>Mattie Myers is only eighteen, now, and she
speaks with all that age-wisdom one finds in
the sober-minded young: "I have been living
over all the delights of the past," she writes to
a friend, "and when the bright dream passed
away before the storm actualities of the present,
my heart has wept that the golden hours of
childhood shall never, never return. True, my
childhood was not all joyous; yet there is a luxury
in remembering even the grief that tore my
young heart. Many changes have taken place
since then. The death-angel has taken from
our circle two dear sisters. Is it not hard for
the human heart, so full of pride, to pass submissive
under the rod? Yet in each affliction
there is a blessing. There is a holy, purifying
influence that the children of God must feel in
order to be made fit for His inheritance,&mdash;an
influence that even mighty truth, alone, cannot
bring; an influence that only trial can exert
upon the proud heart. This will make the
weakest strong; God accepts no sacrifice without
salt or without fire. Trial gives us our
Christian character, brings us into closer communion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
with our God. With it our hearts
may be made fair and pure as the snow that
encircles the mountain-crest. It was a bright-winged
messenger that took from us our sisters,
though with the eye of flesh we could not
see the brightness of His glory."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>
<p>"Many of the old friends are married," she
continues, "and many are sleeping. One hardly
recognizes the old Kentucky Home. Dearest
friends have moved away. The home of one's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
youth seems strange. But of one I must tell
you, one dearer to me than all others&mdash;<i>my
brother</i>. God grant that I may not love him
too well lest I forget Him who gave me one so
dear!"</p>

<p>This year brought the war to a close. We
find Oliver Carr once more on an evangelistic
tour, followed, we may be sure, by best wishes
from Mattie Myers for his success. He is accompanied
by John W. Mountjoy. They borrow
horses at May's Lick, load their saddle-pockets,
and start for the mountains. Let us
take a look at them, July 14, 1865,&mdash;"A
bright, beautiful morning," says Mountjoy,
writing joyously in his pocket-diary; "we rose
with the sun, welcomed by the song of birds
and the gayety of nature."</p>

<p>It is interesting to note just what preaching
means, and what it includes for these young
University students. "We led George and
Davy to water, fed them and rubbed them off."
(Davy is Oliver's colt, so named for David Armstrong,
and George is John's colt, so called
after George Ranck, who trudged on foot
with Oliver to hear his first sermon at a school
house on the Perryville road three miles
from Harrodsburg, and afterward became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the Lexington historian.) "Went to the
house, had prayers, and then breakfast.
Left immediately on our journey for Vanceburg,&mdash;rode
slowly on account of the
lameness of Ol's 'Davy.' Singing joyously"&mdash;this
beautiful morning&mdash;"we reached rows of
cabins humbly situated by the roadside&mdash;the
little children, the old grand-mother with her
white cap&mdash;an old man mowing by the wayside.
I would gladly have helped him, could
I have stopped. * * * We are now at the
blacksmith shop, having 'Davy' shod&mdash;sixteen
miles yet to ride before we reach Vanceburg."</p>

<p>Presently they pass the little school-house
where Oliver learned his first lesson, his a b c's
the first day; the second day it was a-b ab,
and the University student sees himself, barefoot
and tiny, trudging up to the doorway
that looked so large to him then. It is hard
for him to believe that little boy himself. The
years at May's Lick Academy have come since
then, and the years at Harrodsburg, and now
the prospect of years at Lexington. He is
already so removed from that little boy, and
all the world of that little boy, so removed in
life-purposes, in eternal desires! and yet there
is something of the little child in his tall awkward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
form&mdash;or in his heart, rather&mdash;something
always childlike.</p>

<p>"The school-house where Ol. learned his
first lesson," says Mountjoy&mdash;"I could not
enter into half the joys of his sweet remembrances
of happier days." Could not, truly;
but why "happier" days? Is it not because
they are past, those days of youth, never to be
ours again; surely it is not because they were
in reality happier!</p>

<p>We pass through Clarksburg about 12, we
reach Vicksburg about one, and now we&mdash;or I
should say, "I," am sitting on the bank of the
Ohio,&mdash;Oliver is doubtless resting from his
experiences with "Davy." For, "While riding
along about halfway between Mount Carmel
and Vanceburg, talking of Geo. Ranck and
Davy Armstrong, Ol. took a notion that his
beast was becoming insensible to the spur on
his right foot, and concluded he would make a
change. He raised his left leg over the shoulder
of Davy"&mdash;and then we are treated to a bit of
Greek in the diary-narrative, the spirit, if not
the letter, of which may be gleaned from a line
further on&mdash;"I thought Ol. would surely be
killed."</p>

<p>Away goes Davy, free of any spur, scattering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
saddle-pockets and hymn-books to right and
left. A quarter of a mile away he stops, and
looks back at the other borrowed horse as if to
say, "George, throw John Mountjoy off and
let's go back to old man Chancellor!"&mdash;the old
man, evidently from whom they were borrowed.
At which, George's spirit begins to rage, and
Mountjoy has all he can do to keep <i>in statu
quo</i>. And his thought&mdash;if one can afterwards
remember what his thought was at such a
crisis&mdash;ran thus; "Ol. is killed or half-dead; I
suppose I will have all the preaching to do!"
Preaching he has to do, but only his share, but
no funeral, for Ol. staggers up and mounts and
clings. And now we find Mountjoy alone on
the river bank, wishing that the music of the
waves could inspire him to do justice to the
thrilling scene just closed.</p>

<p>But after all, Oliver is not resting up from
his dethronement, for we are presently to discover
him in a situation none too heroic, by the
canons of genteel fiction. We have come
down to the landing to see the steamer "Telegraph."
We are now down the river a little
way. "While I have been writing, Ol. has been
washing his boots, with sand for soap. The
boat has just passed down the river and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
waves are lashing the shore, making melody.
Ol. will preach tonight in the little school-house."</p>

<p>And somewhat further down we find in another
handwriting&mdash;"All sitting together tonight,
and Johnnie proposes that each of us
write something in his diary and sign his name.</p>

<div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">O. A. Carr</span>."
</div>

<p>So the day, bright and beautiful, is at a
close; the waves of the Ohio no longer sparkle
with diamonds as the steamboat plows its way
southward; and the jolts of the journey&mdash;let us
hope&mdash;are eased; and the sermon has been
preached; and if we smile at the thought of
the sand-scouring of the boots, is it not with
the smile of sympathy? For we, too, find
beautiful the feet of those who bring tidings of
great joy! So, as we say, gone is that bright
day of July, so many years ago; and every little
movement in the river one saw that day has,
for many years, lapsed into stillness, to give
place to the movements of other times. But
the words spoken then, the sermon preached,
the hymns sung, the prayers offered,&mdash;who
shall say there is not in the world to-day a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
greater love for humanity, a deeper adoration
of the Christ, because of them?</p>

<p>This same year Mattie Myers wrote,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i2">"The leafy bowers their shadows cast, and on the grass so cool,</span>
<span class="i2">We lay our burning brows and weep the fleeting joys of school"&mdash;</span>
</div>

<p>For her school-days are at last ended.</p>

<p>Four years of instruction under her brother's
surveillance, six more at St. Catherine
de Sienna's and Daughters' College&mdash;ten years
of lingering at the founts of knowledge! And
now that they have slipped away, and the
young girl faces the graver problem of life itself,
the school-girl breaks into swan-song, and
dies to her youth, as she immerges into womanhood:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i2">"We leave thee, Alma Mater, dear, with all the bitter grief</span>
<span class="i2">That farewell brings to loving hearts, yet with a sweet relief,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">A hope to tread thy walks again, to breathe thy fragrant air,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">A hope to hear again thy voice, thy holy truth to share."</span>
</div>

<p>To her mind, education was not only acquirement
of truth, but of holy truth; such an
acquisition as called for its inevitable reward:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i2">"When from the dust the good shall rise</span>
<span class="i2">When glory's streaming from the skies;</span>
<span class="i2">The hand of love a wreath will twine,</span>
<span class="i2">Eternal, glorious, divine."</span>
</div>

<p>"Miss Mattie: Dear Sister&mdash;" What is
this? Nothing less than a Kentucky University
student, writing from "Social Hall," on
the 12th of January, 1866. "Don't be surprised
to find the name of your friend Ollie at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the conclusion of these lines," he goes on,
"though I admit it is enough to surprise you."
But not us! He was disappointed, he says,
because she did not come to Mount Carmel
during his last meeting, "for I had <i>all</i> the
preaching to do myself&mdash;" signifying that there
was no young girl fresh from college to lead the
singing. The letter is all about his evangelistic
work. "Uncle Gilbert, who had not been
within a church for twenty years, was constantly
in his seat before me, looking and listening
with intent interest."</p>

<p>And then he mourns because his sister Mary
did not "purify her soul by obeying the truth
through the spirit." Privately, she tells her
preacher-brother that she believes; but she
will wait awhile before confessing her belief, will
wait for the husband to come. But he does not
come. "I left that dear good sister sitting on
the stile, watching to catch the last glimpse of
me, departing perhaps forever." But that
vacation was not spent in vain. "During two
months I reported 133 additions, organized
four Sunday schools and two churches. Oh,
how happy I would be tonight, if all my dear
relations were among those who have obeyed!"
Then he gives us an insight into the sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
things he and "Miss Mattie" conversed about
at social gatherings. "Although my summer
was indeed a happy one, yet when I returned
to where all are so worldly, my heart seemed
almost broken. I will always remember the
remark you made at President Milligan's reception,
in regard to the conversion of my
parents; and of your faith in prayer."</p>

<p>Serious, indeed, but sweet in its strong helpfulness,
is this correspondence, now springing
up. We have but one side of it, but it reveals
the other. His next letter: "I will never forget
your good advice, nor will I cease to thank
you for it. Mattie, I regard you as my most
wholesome counselor. I seldom find a young
lady who will give me advice; and none ever
gave me more consolation than you. I have
just read your letter, and I feel stronger spiritually.
How cheering to the poor boy, are
these words from a sister in Christ. You ask
me what message you shall bear to Mary"&mdash;the
sister we left gazing sadly from the stile,
waiting, but unready. "If you have an opportunity,
please encourage her to become a Christian.
I took tea with President Williams last
night. He says if he returns to Harrodsburg
next year, he will have you as his assistant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
teacher. I hope you will sufficiently recover
your health to be able to take up that employment
next to the Christian ministry in point of
usefulness, that you may labor for God and
humanity."</p>

<span class="caption">School Days Ended.</span>
</div>

<p>He writes in March: "I have been on a visit
to my sister, Minnie Fox, to attend an exhibition
given by her husband's school. From
there I went to Winchester to preach, and
have just returned. My roommate"&mdash;here he
pauses to take futile revenge&mdash;"Dr. Sweeny, is
amusing himself with his flute and vexing me
no little with his discordant notes. Of course
<i>good natured Ol.</i> bears it all in good part,
hoping however, that the doctor's serenade
will soon conclude!"&mdash;a side-remark which we
might have made ourselves. Then to the more
serious matters: "I admire more than ever the
kind, easy and natural manner breathed in
your letters. Your style portrays a good
heart. I love <i>talking</i> letters, and such talk,
too, that expresses spontaneous emotions.
How happy I am under the conviction that
you feel solicitations about my welfare, and
offer up prayers in my behalf. Mattie, I often
think of your remark to me last June, stating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
what you thought could be done through
faith."</p>

<p>He has two regular appointments now, for
preaching; at Macedonia<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and Providence. He
touches upon the latest news: "I suppose you
have heard of Brother A. Campbell's death.
How sad to think that one so great and good
must lose his power and fade away! 'He had
fought a good fight,' and now goes away to
wear the crown. President Williams will go
back to Harrodsburg. He prefers teaching
young ladies to boys. Mattie! I am trying to
compose an oration on the 'True and Good in
Man,' and would be very much obliged if you
will give a few suggestions. (Bad luck to that
pen for dropping the ink! please excuse the
blot.) I will be very glad to hear from you
soon on the True and Good in Man. Good
night! May the choicest blessings of heaven
be yours, in time and eternity."</p>

<p>Mattie Myers is still seeking to regain her
strength&mdash;for health has fled after the closing
days at Daughters' College; and as she rests,
she reads the "Quarterly,"&mdash;no light reading,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
one would think, for a girl of eighteen&mdash;and
"Aurora Leigh," always her favorite,&mdash;and at
night&mdash;these beautiful nights in May, she goes
to the meeting held at Stanford by Moses E.
Lard. Oliver has no such excuses, he writes
her, for delaying his answer, but he has others
just as good. "I have yet those five studies
this hot weather," he says; "besides, I go to
the country to preach nearly every Lord's day."
However, we would not have her think his
preaching excuses any dereliction of duty. "I
have had occasion to pronounce my love for the
ministry, and I need only say that it is still my
chief delight."</p>

<p>And then he comes to deal with the man
about whom the storm-clouds had gathered,
the favorite professor who used to walk with
the boy Oliver when friends were few and the
University was at Harrodsburg: "Last Friday
night Dr. Pinkerton addressed our society&mdash;the
Philothean,&mdash;to encourage us in our undertaking&mdash;about
twenty-five of us are studying
for the ministry. His subject was 'True
Greatness.' All were entertained with the
originality of his conceptions, and his peculiarly
terse, pointed and feeling manner. It just
seemed a picture of the man revealing his noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
heart, and showing his fervent religious sentiments.
Perhaps you have been prejudiced
against the doctor, owing to his political proclivities.
But Mattie, allow me to say that although
he acted as a Christian should not act,
while overwhelmed in excitement, and had his
all in the 'Negro Bureau,' still, I cannot but
believe he was sincere. <i>Yes!</i> he was so deeply
convinced of the correctness of his position that
he would have been a miserable man, a vile
hypocrite, had he acted otherwise. He is ready
to sacrifice popularity and friends; yes, I verily
believe life itself, for what his conscience tells
him is right. For this I admire him. For his
sympathy, I esteem him; and because he is a
good man, I <i>love</i> him. I know many lips have
hissed stern anathemas against poor, passionate
Dr. Pinkerton; but his goodness will compare
favorably with that of any of his accusers. I
hope the brethren will labor to restore him to
his proper orbit, where he will shine among
the brightest stars of the Reformation."</p>

<p>So this generous young defender goes on and
on, till he reaches a blaze of eloquence of which
we are duly suspicious, knowing not what
element of actuality (which is seldom eloquent)
may have been consumed in the heat of chivalrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
ardor. It is enough to know that we
have found a voice to speak for the man "who
had his all in the Negro Bureau," nor was it a
light thing to speak thus to Mattie Myers,
whose schoolbook is written close with Southern
songs. She loves to sing&mdash;else she would
not have taken the pains to write it down so
carefully&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, yes, I am a Southern girl, and glory in the name,</span>
<span class="i0">And boast it with far greater pride than glittering wealth or fame.</span>
<span class="i0">I envy not the Northern girl her robes of beauty rare</span>
<span class="i0">Though diamonds grace her snowy neck, and pearls bedeck her hair.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Hurrah, hurrah, for the Sunny South so dear!</span>
<span class="i4">Three cheers for the homespun dress</span>
<span class="i2">The Southern ladies wear."</span>
</div></div>

<p>After the exalted strain of the first part of
this letter, we confess to a great satisfaction in
the latter part, which seems to come so much
closer to the ground on which most of us live:
"I delivered your message to Miss Shaw Turner.
She expressed an ardent desire to see you,
and gave evidence to a strong attachment to
you,&mdash;<i>which</i> I suppose you will allow me to
do." (Observe the artfulness of that "<i>which</i>")
"I am very much obliged to you for the invitation
to the railroad picnic, and I think it would
be altogether proper for the <i>Car</i> to beat the
railroad, ric, tic." (A pun! what next?)
"Well, I have heard Brother Lard preach lately;
no wonder I can't write to you! We are anticipating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
a happy time in June at our society exhibitions.
Please come! But before you come,
oblige me by writing some of your thoughts on
this subject: 'The Tears of History and the
Smiles of Prophecy.' This is my subject and
I have not written a word. Jas. C. Keith,
Albert Myles and myself are to represent the
University on the 28th June&mdash;a distinguished
honor, indeed. I am also elected
to represent the Philothean society, and I have
not prepared <i>that</i> speech. Oh, what a fix I'm
in! Please, Mattie, help me! Next summer,
let us visit Mount Carmel again, and go to
sculapia for our health." (Only for our
health?) "Brother Myles sends his kindest regards,
and says he doesn't think near so much
of Miss Ada as of you! Mattie, please write
soon."</p>

<p>Next month comes the "exhibits," and in
July&mdash;this from Oliver,&mdash;"I know you will be
surprised at the caption of this letter&mdash;Ghent,
Carroll County, Kentucky." It does, indeed,
surprise her, for after a year's absence, one
would have supposed the student anxious to
go back to his parents, kindred and friends.
But "I have sacrificed the pleasure of meeting
my loved ones, and given up all, for the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of this people." His roommate, Albert Myles,
has urged him to this course, for Albert, who
has been assisted in College by Mrs. Drusie
Tandy Ellis of Ghent, is called there to hold
the meeting. "College days were over June
28th," he continues. "I underwent six critical,
trying examinations, and prepared my two
speeches&mdash;and was then so sick I could hardly
walk. The doctor brought me out of a weakening
disease so that I could stand on the stage
while I spoke; but that was about all. When
the boys parted for their homes, they left me
in extreme agony. My poor frame was racked
and tortured by unmerciful disease. Many I
did not get to bid goodby&mdash;dear boys! God
be with you, and may we meet again next October.
My roommate, Brother Myles, remained
with me. When I recovered, he plead
so affectionately for his 'chum Ol.' to go with
him to Ghent, that I could not refuse."</p>

<p>And so they go to Covington, and at Cincinnati
take the "Joe Anderson" for the river
town. But in about two weeks, Oliver will be
at Mount Carmel where Mattie is now&mdash;he
urges her to stay till he comes&mdash;and he will
bring her a book by one of his favorite professors&mdash;McGarvey's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
"Commentary"&mdash;solid food
for the young lady, one would think.</p>

<p>Back in the University next fall&mdash;let us hope
in better health than when he left it!&mdash;we find
Oliver again pen in hand: "James Keith, Albert
Myles and myself will finish the course
this year by hard study, having about twenty-five
recitations each week&mdash;and I am in wretchedly
poor condition. I'm fearful of my health's
giving way under the great burden. I hope
and pray for strength of mind and body to
prepare for a long service. I sometimes think
it is almost a sin for us young men who are
preparing for the ministry, to stay here conning
over dull lessons in mathematics, Latin
and Greek. Like a caged bird, I long to be
free of the College-wall cage. I am anxious to
go into the world and preach the Gospel. I
have been telling my friend of how you and I
preach together, and what a good, assistant
preacher you are. How I would like to be with
you and your sister tonight. Dear me! What
a contrast this dull monotony presents to that
blissful happy meeting&mdash;to do such noble work
as that in which we were engaged! Never can
I forget that meeting, nor our trips to Orangeburg!
neither can I forget you who cling so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
tenaciously to 'that good part.' You and Sister
O'Bannon both impressed me as being
God's dear children. Remember your mission
to speak to my sister Mary about becoming a
Christian. I suppose you heard of my good
meeting at Sardis. Forty-five were added&mdash;four
of my cousins among the number. Don't
fail to send that sermon. Mattie, I send the
promised photograph, please send me yours.
Write to me soon, and tell me what you are
doing. I know you are not hearing Brother
Lard <i>now</i>. I think you might write poor Ol. a
long letter very soon!"</p>

<p>"Poor Ol." received the letter; for we find
him answering in a short time&mdash;from his letter
we may gain an insight into hers: "You speak
of your benevolent scheme in progress for the
'poor wanderers of New York.' I do not know
your exact meaning, but ever since I formed
your acquaintance, I have believed you a chosen
instrument of God to accomplish great good
for poor mortals. Now you are making the
step. Dear me! How I wish such a spirit of
Christianity infused itself through the purposes
of the ten thousand accomplished and
efficient young ladies of Kentucky! How much
good might be done by womanhood, if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
would devote their time, means and energy to
alleviating suffering. Perhaps it would be a
better plan to look nearer home. I am glad to
know that you whom God has blessed with a
mind and heart able to conceive, plan and feel,
are breathing a prayer for the distressed.
Mattie, it speaks well for you, and makes me
rejoice. A young friend of mine insists on my
preaching at Mount Sterling that he may obey
the Gospel. I can't refuse to go. I know I
will lose time, and distract my attention from
my studies, but what is that in comparison to
saving a soul? I don't hesitate to go, but will
be off soon. Encourage the building of the
church at Mount Carmel all you can. They
will receive $50.00 from me next summer for
that purpose. Excuse bad writing. You
know I can do better."</p>

<p>In Oliver's next letter&mdash;December&mdash;we find
him in a rather sensitive mood. Mattie has
accused him of "Some egotism clearly manifested
in a parenthesis" he appears to have
stowed away in his last epistle. "Dear me!"
says Oliver, wounded and perplexed, "What
can it be?" After trying to recall anything
that may have prompted her "sarcasm," and
after an eloquent outburst against the meanness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of egotism wherever found, he is obliged
to give it up. After relieving his feelings he
falls back on "Brother Lard," who appears as
a convenient stalking-horse for both sides. "If
you think my writing home a poor excuse for
not writing to you, I have a very good one at
hand. Brother Lard is preaching here every
night. That, as you know (having offered it
yourself) is a valid excuse! I have just returned
from a visit to President Williams who is in
high spirits. He has just been giving me a
lecture on my returning here for still another
year. He is a dear good man, and often gives
me good advice; but I don't think it would be
right, after taking a diploma in the Bible College
and another in the College of Arts, to remain
another year. Now, Mattie, I have always
paid much attention to your advice; what do
you think on the subject? You know my
deficiences; but you also know my burning desire
to be at work. Like you, I admire Geo.
D. Prentice's 'Closing Year' extravagantly.
He has immortalized himself with that inimitable
production. What a pity that such a
man is not a Christian! The world is presenting
a sad picture. The people are beginning
to lose confidence even in the clergy. I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
convinced that, as a Christian body, we are
more in need of deep-toned piety than of anything
else. We have more learning than we
put to good use. We need exemplary conduct
in young men and women. I am going to
start out in the New Year to live a holier,
better and consequently a happier life. Please
remember me in your prayers."</p>

<p>Our next letter to "Miss Mattie," dated
December 25th, is not from Oliver Carr, but
from another University student, who signs
himself by his initials. Poor young gentleman,
we seek not to know his name, as he pours out
his love of near half a century gone. Her
"very welcome favor," it appears, had nipped
his sweetest hopes in the bud, but he was
"glad to receive it." He goes to the point:
"You say that no more intimate relationship
can exist between us than that of friendship.
Miss Mattie, why not? I do not presume to
ask for details, whether your heart is prepossessed
in favor of another or whether * * *"
But no, this was very real to the "D.,"
of those days, let us not listen to his
heart-beats, but hope rather that "D." now
sixty-odd, if he is a day, has long since forgotten
all about it. He is introduced here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
merely to cast one tiny ray upon the character-development
of the young lady addressed: "In
the mean time, you will allow me to thank you
very sincerely for the candor with which you
have dealt with me, not only in this correspondence,
but ever since our acquaintanceship."
And then, remembering that it is the
25th, he adds with a stout heart, "Just while
I think of it, I will take your 'Christmas
Gift!'"</p>

<p>He gives a flash-light of those vacation days:
"Most of the students have gone to their
homes. Egg-nog is flowing freely here. The
landlady has it in abundance, today. Some
of the company partook largely; among them I
noticed two young ladies. By the way, a little
news afloat: Miss Jennie Lard is to be married
to a very interesting youth" (Note the bitterness
of our rejected lover!) "of fifty and odd
summers: This lovely lad is Woodson, a lawyer
of St. Louis, who is very promising for a
mere beginner in this up-hill business of life.
In the exuberance of his youthful feelings he
has presented her with a gold watch, rings infinite,
and earbobs not a few." (Oh, the bitterness
of it!)</p>

<p>Then, in this incidental fashion, we find introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
a subject which is presently to deepen
until it envelops all other thoughts of Mattie
Myers: "Alex. Milligan received a letter of
twelve pages from Brother Gore, dated Liverpool.
He and Surber intend to start for Australia
on the 21st"&mdash;two young friends of
Oliver Carr and Mattie Myers, going forth as
missionaries. "They have visited Spurgeon's
tabernacle, Crystal Palace, etc. They describe
the English manner of worship, different from
ours. They have no preaching Lord's Day
morning; that part of the day is spent in taking
the Lord's Supper, Scripture reading, etc.
Preaching at night." And then "D." enters
upon the subject of Conscience, in which it
seems Mattie is greatly interested; but our own
will not permit us to follow him into those intricate
depths.</p>

<p>Three months pass by, but Oliver has not
forgotten Mattie's thrust: "I do wish you
had gratified me by sending the sentence in
quotation in which I expressed <i>egotism</i>. I
have been much troubled about it and I would
like to know exactly what it was." Then after
several pages of severe self-inspection, to find
the contamination, he urges her to see again
his sister Mary and his other relatives who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
out of the church, and continue with zest, in
finding a delightful means of prolonging this
correspondence: "You say that the affirmative
of the question, 'Will Christ's Second
Coming be Premillenial?' is Scriptural. Well,
we will have a debate, if you say so. You must
make the first speech; I'm simply to reply.
But as suggestive of the arguments, I wish
you "to prove to me, First * * *"</p>

<p>And so they debate; and spring blooms in
Kentucky, and summer comes with its hard
work and balmy airs. Mattie Myers is not as
strong as she might be, but she has had a long
rest, and can rest no longer; for that active
spirit calls her to her chosen work. She has
already done some teaching, but in the autumn
of 1867, she purchases Franklin College at
Lancaster, and starts definitely upon her career.
She is the president, of course; and she
feels as she walks the familiar streets,&mdash;no
longer a little girl under her brother Joe's tutelage,
but a grave young teacher&mdash;a girl of
twenty now, surrounded by other girls&mdash;that
her life-work has, indeed, begun. Her first
school! It does not, indeed, promise that wide
field she has so long coveted; the conditions are
straight, the capabilities rather narrow; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
after all, it will serve for a time. Why it served
so short a time&mdash;but one school term, in all,&mdash;may
be gleaned from the continuation of the
correspondence:</p>

<p>"I confide in you," Oliver writes in September,
"as I do in my own kin. The plain truth
is that you seem much nearer to me than some
of my kindred who are ever opposing my
humble work. I am thankful that I ever met
you, and that we have learned to sympathize
with each other. I made a flying visit to
Mount Carmel, and cannot say how sad I felt
at not seeing you there. I preached at Orangeburg,
and had the pleasure of receiving among
others, my little cousin Rachel. I have long
been praying for her conversion. I baptized
her and her husband both at the same time.</p>

<p>"From there I went to the State Meeting at
Lexington, and a happy time I had. It was
said by old men that they had never known
one so <i>good</i>. During the meeting, a letter was
received and read before the convention by
Brother J. W. McGarvey. It was from Brother
Surber. He stated very touchingly the need of
more preachers in Australia, and urged Brother
Myles and me to come. He expressly stated
that the Australian brethren had&mdash;under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
recommendation of himself and Gore&mdash;selected
<i>us</i>, and wanted no others. Brother Surber
wrote to me, and gave a description of Melbourne,
where he wants me to preach. His
description made me wonder at the degree of
refinement there. The city is beautifully
adorned with flower-gardens; 140,000 inhabitants.
He imagines I'm there, walking with
him through the city. He says, 'Come, Ollie,
it is just as near Heaven from this country as
from Kentucky.' He says we will be to the
Cause there what Walter Scott and Barton
Stone were here, etc. The brethren there are
almost wild for an evangelist from Kentucky;
have sent $800.00 in gold to bear expenses of
Brother Myles and myself. Above all considerations,
the good I might do is the grandest&mdash;to
preach to people who are not tired of hearing!
I know my relatives will oppose my going,
and that it will almost break my heart to leave
them; but I cannot consult flesh and blood. I
have prayed and wept over this, but I cannot
escape the conviction that it is my duty
to go. All the brethren except Dr. Pinkerton
advised me to go. President Milligan just
wept like a child. I've not let the folks at
home know anything about it; there is great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
excitement here. Mattie, what do you think of
my going? Would you go with me? <i>I'm in
earnest.</i> Brother Keith and I are holding a
meeting at Millersburg. I wish I had you as
an assistant preacher, as I did last summer. I
hear that people are well educated in Australia.
Please write immediately."</p>

<p>We have broken the news to the reader, just
as it was broken to Mattie Myers; but there is
a difference; for in those days, knowledge of
Australia was very superficial in Kentucky. It
was immensely farther away then than now,
and in proportion as it took so long to go there,
to that degree did it appear wild and barbarous,
semi-civilized at best. To Carr, Myles
and Keith, the senior class of 1867,&mdash;the three
young preachers and roommates, who were
called "the Trio,"&mdash;the Australians were a
mixture of exported English convicts and bush-men
with bristling hair. To their imagination,
an Australian was hardly to be classified
with any of the recognized races of mankind;
he was a mongrel, a mystery. And even if
they could have received the enthusiastic laudations
of young Surber and Gore, the perils of
months upon the deep which rendered passage
full of dangers, and a speedy return impossible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
must still have appalled the fancy. To go to
Australia, then, was to cut away from the old
life with all its ties of love, of laughter and of
tears, and to find what consolation one might
in the thought that the distance from there to
heaven was as short as from a Kentucky haven!</p>

<p>The next month, Oliver writes to Mattie
Myers: "Your touching letter gave me more
encouragement in my expected trip to Australia
than any I have received, leaving my heart
literally steeped in faith, hope and love. I
hated to tell you my plan, for you are always
holding up to my view the amount of work to
be done in Kentucky. This is the hardest
question I was ever called on to decide. It
came to me something like the question of my
soul's salvation. At the State Meeting, old
and young advised me to go&mdash;all except Dr.
Pinkerton, whose counsel was always very
weighty with me. His argument was that the
people of Northeast Kentucky need my labor
too badly, and that their souls are just as
precious as those in Australia. But you know
that in Lewis County I have not the opportunities
to labor that I'd have in Australia. Life
is too short&mdash;we must use every advantage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
There are others to take my place in this
country.</p>

<p>"I wept all the way from Lexington. And
then I placed in the scales, home with all the
meaning of HOME&mdash;father, mother, sisters,
brothers, and friends&mdash;and no one has dearer
friends than I, and God knows I love them
dearly,&mdash;and on the other side I placed the salvation
of perhaps thousands of souls, the love
of Jesus and his Cause. I looked at the balance
with tearful eyes, and resolved to tell parents,
kindred and friends adieu. The scale
turned. My love for all dear to me on earth,
cannot deter me from going with glad tidings
to the weary and heavy-laden. And yet how
sad to leave you and all others so dear. I declare,
it almost breaks my heart. Yet go I
must! I wrote home and told all about it.
Oh, I hated to let my poor mother know anything
about it. I am to stay three or five
years. I will have an audience of 1,000 every
Sunday. The salary will be $1,000 in gold.
Some of this I will send home to my poor parents;
and some to my brother Dick whom I am
going to educate; and some to the young man
I am already educating for the ministry. I am
going to make one more strong appeal to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
parents to obey the Gospel. How shall I be
able to tell them goodby, if I am to go away
with no hope of meeting them in heaven? I
am glad you have such a good school. Oh,
you are doing a noble work! Just think of
training 90 or 100 little hearts and leading them
to Jesus!"</p>

<p>December comes, and the stress of resolution
grows harder to bear: "I have come home at
last, but not to rejoice in the association of
friends. I am chilled by translation from a
fervid spiritual labor and fellowship of the
saints, into a fellowship of worldly affairs where
every effort is to get something to eat, drink
and wear, with scarcely a thought of the hereafter.
Brother Dick is dangerously ill. The
dear fellow suffers the most excruciating pain.
As I gaze upon his tender form, I wonder if I
am ever to realize that thought&mdash;my brother, a
preacher! Added to this sorrow is the sympathy
I have for my poor mother, who weeps
whenever Australia is mentioned. It is very
distressing. All charge me with not loving
them. My dear father rests his heavy head
upon his hand, and weeps to think of the
future. His frail body is tottering as he descends
the hill of life. I fear I shall never see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
him again, after I say farewell. It well nigh
breaks my heart to hear them chide me for resolving
to go on that long, long voyage. I
close this sad picture by throwing myself into
my only refuge&mdash;faithful prayer, and immortal
hope." The next part of the letter shows that
Oliver was "in earnest" when he asked Mattie
Myers to go with him:</p>

<p>"In Lexington I met Brother McGarvey on
the street" (his teacher with whom he lodged
during his last year at the University.) "He
urged me to tell him all that happened during
my brief visit to you at Lancaster" (where she
is teaching her first school.) "In confidence, I
told him your objections and difficulties. When
I had finished, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I admire her consideration. It is a serious
question, I admit. With regard to her health,
and the dangers of the voyage, you and she are
on a common footing. She need not be deterred
by the supposition that you die and
leave her in that distant land; the brethren
here would, in that case, have her safely returned
home.' He urged our marriage, and
trip to Australia. He was delighted with the
idea of having you there as a teacher. We
talked of the sacrifice of your school at Lancaster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and he argued that it would be far better
for the cause of Christianity and education
to have some one take your place in Lancaster,
and have you occupy a higher sphere of usefulness.
I wish you had been present to hear him
talk; he is a dear, good fellow. With his strong
clear brain, he adjusts his plans; with an eye of
faith, he views the future. I pray you, weigh
his opinions in your well-balanced judgment
before you conclude. I talked with President
Williams; I fear he will not advise you to go.
Brother McGarvey says it will depend upon the
mood in which you find him. Then <i>do</i> cheer
him up, and prepare him for a happy answer!"</p>

<p>The letter concludes with urging the marriage,
cautioning her against giving heed to the
advice of others&mdash;as in the case of John Augustus
Williams&mdash;but the wisdom of <i>sometimes</i>
heeding the counsel of others&mdash;for instance,
that of John W. McGarvey.</p>

<p>"Though a stranger to you in person&mdash;" What
is this? A letter written to Mattie Myers
by this very J. W. McGarvey! "By request
of Brother Carr," he says. One would
not expect a passionate, enthusiastic burst of
eloquence from the author of the "Commentary
on Acts." What is said here, emanates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
from a "strong, clear brain." As the Bible
instructor sees it, the situation stands thus:
"After all, your own heart must decide whether
you go or stay. One thing seems certain, that
<i>he</i> will go. It is for you to endure his long absence,
and risk the uncertainties of his return,
or share the voyage with him, and help the
noble cause to which he consecrates his all."</p>

<p>This same month, Oliver returns to the
charge: "I waited a week with the keenest
anxiety, hoping each night to get an answer
from you. It has come at last. Mattie! I anticipated
what it would be, from reading President
Williams' letter. I know he has tried to
mould your life for teaching, alone. He is true
and noble and I doubt not he gave you, as you
say, 'his wisest judgment and the fullest expression
of his good heart on the subject.' I
believe he meant to point to our highest good;
but I cannot follow his advice. I have pondered
both your and his reasons for wishing delay.
Both of you urge a year's preparation.
Well, what kind of preparation? You are already
prepared to teach those in Australia; and
I know I can tell them what to do to be saved.
I know I am weak; but Northeast Kentucky is
not the place for me to get strong. You say I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
'need to know assuredly that I can meet stern
realities victoriously.' I do not think I will
know more about that than I do now, till I
meet them. Of course a year's experience
would increase my usefulness, but why not acquire
it where the brethren want me? I don't
know what especial point you had in view by
saying you would like a year's hard study under
President Williams. What were you going
to study? You have taken his full course, I
presume. We have simply the story of the
Cross to tell and I believe that we can do it
<i>now</i>."</p>

<p>So the letter goes on for eight closely-written
pages, showing the fervor of eloquence quite
lacking in the concise review by McGarvey;
but, then, it was not McGarvey who was in
love. Oliver is in love, doubly so; first and
always first, with his Cause; and then always
with Mattie. It is a terrible struggle for the
young girl, for she too, is in love; but her
affections have always associated teaching with
the Cause. She must know in her heart that
this missionary enterprise is a divergence from
her central idea, however much more good it
may accomplish. Here is her college, bought
and paid for, and here are her 90 or 100 girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
for training. She may hope for different blessings
beyond the seas, but not of this sort.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;Considering His Letter.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>And here is her brother Joe bitterly opposed
to the plan, as one's brother Joe may very
naturally be. It is well enough for McGarvey,
who thinks first of the dissemination of the
Gospel, to smile upon her going; and how could
Williams, whose ideal for woman is the vocation
of teaching, say otherwise than wait? It
is well enough for Oliver to see but one course
before him; he never entertained himself with
dreams of teaching school. He always meant
to preach, and Australia means more of it,
with wider good to hope for. But it is no
simple problem for Mattie Myers.</p>

<p>A one-sided correspondence, we have been
treated to, which, though one-sided, has nevertheless
given us as good an insight into the one
addressed as if she had done all the writing;
better perhaps; for now we are to hear her
voice, which in its agitation and perplexity,
does not, it may be, reveal her as she is:</p>

<p>"I have stretched forth my hands and nailed
my heart to the Cross. You may cast it from
you, but conscience nailed it there. For awhile
I cheated myself with the belief that its voice
mingled with the voice of my heart, 'You are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
already prepared; go with him.' But it was
only the echo of my heart's happy song. I feel
that I would be an incumbrance, rather than
your co-worker. However mournfully my heart
may cry, however beseechingly, <i>I cannot go
with you</i>. Conscience, my guide, beckons me,
and fervently I follow, though my heart is torn
asunder. Ah, the bloodless battles that are
fought in our world! You have said, 'Although
I love you as I love no one else on earth,
still, if you deny me, I must go alone.' I say
in reply, that though I love you with that love of
which only a Christian woman is susceptible, I
cannot go with you. Your capabilities fit you
for one field of labor, mine fit me for another.
We have all to build an altar. I have built mine,
and laid thereon my tenderest feelings, the
yearning desire of the woman-nature to be
loved. I know that this mysterious yearning
which God has planted with his own hand in
woman's heart will, if left unsatisfied, cast a
shadow over her life; that however strong,
however self-reliant a woman may be, her heart
reaches out for something to complete her happiness.
But the giant will can strengthen the
trembling, faltering heart.</p>

<p>"And it is well to nail the heart to the Cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
that raises it nearer to God. He will give it
strength to suffer. And his love can never fail.
Do not think that I am staggering under complaint.
Like a cheerful traveler I will take up
my life-burden, and continue the journey, with
a song in my mouth, keeping time to the voice
of conscience and my God. Do not think for a
moment, Ollie, that I would dissuade you from
entering upon your grand mission. What I
said to you before I knew you loved me, I say
to you now, though it wrings my heart with an
anguish that I sometimes think cannot be
borne. Sometimes I feel that my heart must
break, but it is sustained by the love of God.
If conscience bids you go, then you must go.
But I cannot conceive how conscience would say
to you to leave a field in which laborers are few,
for one which may cost you your life. I am impressed
that going is a matter of inclination
rather than of conscience. Nevertheless, if conscience
does tell you so, then I urge you with
all the earnestness of my soul, to go. Go; and
the burdens of my prayers will be for him so
far away, and yet so very near."</p>

<p>Alas! how great a mountain is our own conscience,
and how small a molehill that of our
neighbor! Mattie, who has been pointing out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
that all her future misery is to come from obeying
her own, pauses to doubt if Oliver's conscience
is a conscience at all! On such provocation
as that, who can blame Oliver for having
doubts about Mattie's conscience? That he
did have doubts, and that he did his utmost
to cause her to agree with him, no one can
doubt with the following letter before him:</p>

<p>"Dear Mattie:&mdash;Yours received. I heartily
agree to March 26th as <i>our wedding day</i>. I
will write to tell sister Mary and Matt to come
down to May's Lick on the 27th. Saturday I
will deliver my farewell address here. We will
go to Maysville en route for Cincinnati. Horace
came from Flemingsburg yesterday to find out
something about it. Matt, Bud and Mollie
are coming.</p>

<p>"Mattie, I have the best kind of news to tell
you. Hold your breath while you read. Father
came forward at church yesterday, and made
the good confession. 'Bless the Lord, O my
soul and all that is within me, bless his holy
name!' I recognized in that, the answer to
many a prayer. And now if my mother would
obey the gospel I would believe your prophecy
uttered at President Milligan's reception was
fulfilled. Do you remember what it was?&mdash;'Brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Ollie, I believe God will make you instrumental
in bringing your family into the
fold.' Oh, will that ever be? Mother won't
go to church. She has never heard me preach
but twice; but I will pray on, and hope on."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>"I WILL GO."</h3>


<p>It was September, 1867 that Oliver
Carr asked Mattie Myers to go with
him to Australia. For six months
she hesitated, refused, wavered. It
was not a question of devotion to
each other, but of loyalty to the life-ideal of
each. Going to Australia meant three or five
or seven years away from Mattie's chosen vocation.
She weighed at its full value the argument
that she could teach in Melbourne; of
course, she could teach; but teaching must
necessarily be subordinate to missionary work.
Mattie did not undervalue the importance of
missionary labors; but neither did she undervalue
the importance of touching girls' lives in
the school room.</p>

<p>In the struggle, McGarvey and Williams, as
we have seen, took opposite sides; McGarvey
was for his pupil, Oliver; Williams was for his
pupil, Mattie. Each looked at the question
from his point of view. To the President of
the Bible College, what was more important
than carrying the Bible across the sea? To the
President of Daughters' College, teaching was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the exalted vocation of woman&mdash;Let O. A. Carr
do his man's work, he argued; and let Mattie
Myers do her woman's work.</p>

<p>And there was brother Joe, who had done so
much for Mattie&mdash;the brother whom she feared
she might love too well&mdash;pleading, arguing, exhorting.
"Let Oliver go to Australia," he insisted,
"and when he comes back&mdash;at the end
of his five or seven years, then, if you and he
think as much of each other as you do now,
why&mdash;" But the proposition seemed quite
safe, so he added with a stout heart, "then
you can get married!" But on this side of the
five years, No! Never! And when words fail
him, and arguments need to be rested, each
having done service so often for want of new
ones&mdash;Joe gets his flute and sits on the piazza
with Mattie, these balmy spring evenings of
1868, and plays and plays&mdash;plays always the
old familiar melodies, the airs that are wrapped
up with her most sacred memories&mdash;"Old Kentucky
Home," and "Home, Sweet Home," and&mdash;we
fear&mdash;"Bonnie Blue Flag" that carries up
the bars and would sweep the stars from the
Heaven of Union blue.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 268px;">
<img src="images/ill-156.png" width="268" height="450" alt="&quot;I Will Go.&quot;" title="&quot;I Will Go.&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;I Will Go.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>All this is too much for Mattie; her own conscience,
the advice of Williams, "that prince of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
instructors," as she calls him, and beloved Joe;
all cry out against Australia. She writes to
Oliver&mdash;</p>

<p>"I pray that the love of God may
strengthen you to accomplish your holy mission,
and bring you back to waiting hearts in
your own Kentucky land. I may regret the
decision that prevents me from going with you.
I may, after you are gone, regret that my hand
is not to help you; I weep to labor with you. I
do not know. But I have tried to enlighten
my conscience, and it must not be disregarded.
Go, and give to the weary rest, and to those
that thirst, of the well of living water. Though
I must suffer, there is a morn and land beyond
it all. Go, and work for God."</p>

<p>In these days when evangelistic work would
permit Oliver to come to Lancaster, he visited
Mattie Myers as her accepted suitor. After
her day's work in the schoolroom, she listened
to his reading of "Lady of Lyons," and after
the "Lady of Lyons" had had her say, talk
would drift to Australia. It was at the conclusion
of such a talk at Mt. Carmel&mdash;how
earnest we may imagine&mdash;when Joe was not
there&mdash;<i>that</i> we may take for granted&mdash;the
young teacher rose with the solemnity of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
who takes an irretrievable step, having counted
all the costs&mdash;"I will go!"</p>

<p>Those are her words. And having spoken,
the matter is settled. Let poor Joe play his
flute-airs, and look mournfully into space; let
Williams say what he will, or Pinkerton, or
anybody else. Mattie has spoken. That
means a wedding-day on March the twenty-sixth.</p>

<p>Not that Joe understands how unalterable is
her mind. Indeed, he is in no condition to
bear the truth. That voyage seems to him a
death, the going out from his life of the dearest
object of his affections. He grows wild when
she tries to make him understand her mind.
When Oliver reasons with him, he no longer
answers with arguments, but with mere incoherent
passion, partly anger, partly despair.
So this is what we will do; we will go to Mt.
Carmel without telling Joe,&mdash;yonder at the
home of the sister, Mrs. O'Bannon, where we
first met, whence we took that Spring-wagon
excursion to the ineffective spring of sculapia.
Mattie will take the stage that comes
down to Maysville. Oliver will be standing
upon the pike, out of sight of any kinsman's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
house. Mattie will order the stage to stop.
He will get in&mdash;off we will go.</p>

<p>And so we might have made our trip without
incident, without sorrow, but for the unforeseen,
in this instance, embodied in brother
Joe. He suddenly appears, wild and excited,
having come in such nervous haste, that his
hat is left at home. Hatless, but not breathless,
he stops that stage and holds it while he
delivers himself of all his arguments, seeking to
bury Australia in an avalanche of spontaneous
eloquence. But the word Mattie has spoken
before the blazing hearth she speaks on the
open pike: "I will go."</p>

<p>Why argue further? Clearly conscience
nerves her to her purpose! Conscience&mdash;or
love. Only one term of her first school so
proudly begun&mdash;and she has put it in charge of
another, and is starting forth to merge her life-work
into that of another&mdash;and he, a stranger
not long ago,&mdash;a mere lad gathering the shavings
in the wagon-shop to start the tavern fires.</p>

<p>Events now come thick and fast. We are
getting ready for the wedding now. Oliver
rides in a buggy with a schoolmate from his
home town, May's Lick, through Lexington to
Lancaster, the home of Mattie Myers. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
times he stops on the way for farewells. The
reception committee come forth in strength,
but their spokesman bursts into tears, and
Oliver is received with tears only. Albert
Myles, his six-year schoolmate accompanies
him to Lancaster. The wedding is to be at
five in the morning. Bells ring. The village
people, thinking there is a fire, are roused and
come forth. Learning that it is a wedding,
they troop to the church. The spectators look
on through their tears, thinking vaguely of the
other side of the globe, whither the bridal pair
is presently to set forth. Albert Myles performs
the ceremony. It is a scene of early light
and tears. "Mattie going away!" is the murmur&mdash;Mattie
whom these folk have known
from infancy&mdash;going away in early womanhood,
perhaps never to return!</p>

<p>From Lancaster to Lexington in a carriage;
and here J. B. Bowman, the University necromancer,
gives the bride and groom a dinner in
his home, once the home of Henry Clay,&mdash;Ashland,
where we have seen Walter Scott admiring
the picture of George Washington. Teachers
and pupils of the University assemble, and
there is another mournful farewell. In the afternoon,
from Lexington to Stony point, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
goodby to Mrs. Fox, that sister Minnie of the
May's Lick days. At Millersburg, another
wedding-dinner, given by Alex. McClintock,
and then to May's Lick, thirty-six miles by
carriage.</p>

</div>

<p>Here they remain over Sunday&mdash;the last
Sunday in the old May's Lick church, in which
Eneas Myall is a deacon,&mdash;the blacksmith who
said when first hearing the news, "I am sorry
to see you go, Ollie, but it seems providential!"
The elders of the church, the same who were
elders when Walter Scott preached there, ordained
Oliver on that last Sunday at home.
He was surrounded by old friends, tearful but
exultant in their sorrow. There was one who
could not come because, "I can't tell him goodby,"
he said. That was Oliver's hard task
now, to say goodby to all, hardest of all to
those of his father's house. But he had
nerved himself for the ordeal. "I could tell
them all goodby," he says, "until I came to
my mother."</p>

<p>They go, according to their plans, straight
to Maysville, across the county, to take boat
for Cincinnati. Not alone do Mattie and Oliver
make that journey. His mother is with
them. News runs before; the Australian missionaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
are coming! The word is quickly
passed back and forth, that there will be services
at the church. When Oliver arrives he
finds the appointment made. He rises to
preach. It is his last night in Kentucky. Before
his vision stretches a long vista of uncertain
years in a strange land; years among
strangers for this man who is blessed with so
many friends. But that sorrow is swallowed
up in the deeper joy of presenting Christ to
the people, showing forth his loveliness for the
last time in the land of his birth.</p>

<p>That sermon is not preserved, for which we
are, we believe, sufficiently thankful. If love in
its fulness cannot be spoken, much less can it
be read. There is a simplicity and an inner
earnestness, that is altogether baffling to the
snare of leaded type. Whatever the subject of
that sermon, Christ was in it, and we care
nothing for its divisions and its order. We are
thrilled with joy by that sermon&mdash;we who
never heard it,&mdash;because we see the preacher's
mother step forth&mdash;at last!&mdash;and stand before
them all like a beautiful dream come true&mdash;or
rather, like a spirit of love, whose enkindled
face flashes into the son's eyes the answer to
his prayers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Not in vain, as we have seen, were her lonely
vigils, sewing far toward midnight in the sleep-enwrapped
tavern, that her children might be
clothed, toiling before break of day, the pale
candle guiding her hands to heroic labor that
her loved ones might be fed. Much does Oliver
owe her, and much is now repaid, on this
last night in Kentucky. He baptized her; and
as she came up out of the water, with his arm
so tenderly passed about her, she looked at him
through her wonderful, new-found happiness.
"If all were as easy to obey as baptism," she
murmured, "it would be easy enough!"</p>

<p>And so,&mdash;the boat to Cincinnati where W.
T. Moore's father-in-law, he who is later to become
Governor Bishop of Ohio,&mdash;entertains the
bridal pair in his home, and other friends
assemble for goodbys,&mdash;the goodbys at Macomb,
Illinois. And then to New York to set
forth for Australia, by way of England. On
board at last&mdash;and under a sullen sky they
stand on deck, watching their native land fade&mdash;fade&mdash;till
nothing is to be seen but a world
of angry waves.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>AN ENGLISH PRIMROSE.</h3>


<p>The voyage, begun on a rough sea,
was continued over angry waves.
For seven days the ship was beaten
by the winds. It was the first time
Oliver and Mattie had been outside of
Kentucky. Added to the distress of seasickness
was the thought that, after this passage
to England, another voyage of almost three
months awaited them before they could set
foot upon the strange land selected for their
missionary labors. No wonder as the bride
was borne farther and farther across the uneasy
Atlantic, her thoughts went constantly
back to Kentucky&mdash;"That far-off land," she
writes, "my beautiful, sunny Southland."</p>

<p>Since the wedding-day, there have been a
marvelous succession of strange scenes&mdash;the
trip to New York, the hurried visits to points
of interest in New York and Brooklyn, the
mingling with the rush and roar of Broadway,
and, stranger than all these, this helpless tossing
in the cabin, as the ship throbs and lifts
dizzily in air&mdash;lifts to sink down and down, as
if never to ride the sea again.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"That Twenty-Sixth day of March!" she
writes in pencil with shaking hand. "It
dawned so bright and beautiful. In its soft
morning twilight I knelt before an altar, and
laid thereon not only the heart of a bride, but
all that I had best known in childhood and in
girlhood: Home with all its tender associations,
friendship whose face shone as the face
of an angel&mdash;the sweet brier that shed its fragrance
beneath my window, the birds that
sang for me, the dear old 'big spring' over
whose cooling-ripples I have so often stooped to
drink"&mdash;she remembers all these, as the ship
bears her farther from that America she may
never see again.</p>

<p>"Our blessed land of liberty," she says,
"proud, beautiful, glorious America!" Truly,
the war is over; and as she steams ever farther
away from America, its states seem to melt
magically into one another, and North and
South blend, and become an indissoluble Union.</p>

<p>One day, less stormy than the rest, the
young husband crept from his berth, hoping
to find relief from days of nausea by greeting
the keen wind. He went upon deck, and was
presently engaged in conversation with a
stranger.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>He found that his companion was an Englishman
who, for some time, had been in business
in Chicago. He was much interested in
the young man's missionary plans; the shrewd
merchant read aright the intense zeal which
shone upon the Kentuckian's face, and which
trembled in his voice. "I have a brother living
in London," he said; "when you go there, you
must go to his house. I am on my way to visit
him now, and I'll meet you there."</p>

<p>Oliver Carr had no intention of going to test
the hospitality of a stranger, and, when he
gave Mr. Murby his card, he supposed the incident
closed. On the eighth day out the ship
touched at Queenstown. Mr. and Mrs. Carr&mdash;we
must no longer call them "Oliver" and
"Mattie,"&mdash;took a ride on a Jaunting Car&mdash;in
which one sits sidewise, while one's driver
sparkles with Irish wit. A woman came to sell
them fruit, and offered to toss pennies for the
difference between what she wanted and they
were willing to give. It was a jolly crowd that
surrounded them, and every Irishman had a
funny tale to tell the travelers. Before the
ground ceased its semblance of rocking to and
fro, they were again on board.</p>

<p>When they landed in Liverpool, everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
seemed new and strange. They "found cabs
instead of busses;" but doubtless the difference
was most marked because they found Englishmen
instead of Americans. At the hotel they
were visited by G. Y. Tickle and other members
of the church, and in the afternoon they crossed
to Berkinhead to visit other Christians.
On April 29th the train pulled out at 9 a. m.
for London. Mrs. Carr took a few notes, as
she looked upon Mrs. Browning's world&mdash;the
world of "Aurora Leigh."</p>

<p>"Corn&mdash;undulating lands&mdash;rural improvements&mdash;daisies
and primroses. Hedges&mdash;winding
roads, and footpaths. Drains in the lowlands.
Winding brooks and brooklets, through
daisied meadows. Fir-clad hills."</p>

<p>Out of this primrose England, the car glides
into the smoke and fog of London. London
at last&mdash;how far away from the Lancaster and
Stanford of one's girlhood! How far, indeed,
even from the dreams of one's girlhood, this
city that rises up, solidly real before the young
woman's eyes! It seems pulsing with the
thoughts of those who represent, to her mind,
the highest peaks of literature; Dickens and
Thackeray, George Eliot and Robert Browning,
Bulwer Lytton and Macaulay and Carlyle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
De Quincy&mdash;all are living; one might meet them
any moment on Oxford or Regent streets, where
"I took a promenade," she says; "I find they
surpass Broadway in all but dress."</p>

<p>At 2:30, they are installed at the hotel; at
three, they take luncheon and at four they
have a visitor. It is the brother of the Chicago
merchant. The merchant has written
about the missionaries, and asked that they be
looked up&mdash;doubtless, suspecting that the overtures
must come from the English side. So
this brother has come, a Mr. Murby of some
distinction; for does he not edit the music department
of the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i>?</p>

<p>He insists on the young bridal pair going to
his own home; for O. A. Carr, in honor of the
honeymoon, has selected a hotel of much pretention.
"You must go with me," says Mr.
Murby. "It is too expensive, staying at a
hotel like this; you shall make your home in
my house. My wife will take no refusal. She
will entertain you as well as she can&mdash;we have
one baby in the cradle, and another three years
old. I've brought the wagon for the trunks."</p>

<p>All this from a man and woman one has
never seen before, and never heard of, except
from a chance fellow-passenger; a man and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
woman who do not belong to one's church and
has never heard of one's friends! But, after
all, is it so strange? If one travels through
the world with eyes open for primroses, and
finds them growing along the wayside, why
should not eyes that seek brotherly kindness,
find it blooming in many a stranger's heart?</p>

<p>Away go the trunks, and the hotel knows
our friends no more. Two weeks are to be
spent in England, before sailing for the opposite
side of the globe; and while they are in England,
Mrs. Murby leaves the baby in the cradle,
and acts as guide for the Americans. In their
hurried visit, they could have seen little without
her. She takes them to ride in the underground
railroad, shows them the wonders of
the waxworks, at the entrance of which stands
George Washington with extended hand, and
lingers with them in the British Museum.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr's notes of her travels are meager
in the extreme; she was too busy observing and
studying, to write about what she saw; but the
necessary enlargement of thought resulting
from extended travel was to take its own part
in developing her personality. "Chelsea Hospital

<p>Thus we might follow her from spot to spot,
as she hastily jots down the names of pictures,
and of the illustrious dead, amidst a catalogue
of wonders seen at the Crystal Palace, the India
Museum, the National Gallery. "St. Paul&mdash;Whispering

spot of historic interest to another, the travelers
absorbing all with thirsty minds, the hostess
tireless, or at least uncomplaining&mdash;and at night
the profound sleep of the sight-seer's utter
exhaustion.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Murby took the stranger-guests
to their hearts, and treated them like
long-lost friends. The perfume of their
gracious hospitality invested London with a
tender aroma for these wanderers, to such a degree
that whenever they afterward thought of
England, they thought of disinterested kindliness.
On one of Mrs. Carr's diary-pages, is to
be seen a faint brownish stain, above which is
written: "Found by Mrs. Murby on the
streets of London&mdash;this primrose." The flower
has long since slipped away and crumbled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
dust, since it was placed there in the spring of
1868; I should like to think that it blooms
again on my page, in honor of that quick and
loving eye that discovered the primrose in the
London streets, and the gold in the strangers'
hearts.</p>

<p>On Sunday, they went to hear Spurgeon
preach. It was a very ordinary sermon; his
statements had been made thousands of times
before, and to none who listened, were they
new. His manner was untheatrical, his flow
of eloquence was not intense. Everything was
the essence of simplicity. He began by holding
up a rose. He said that on his way to the
tabernacle, a woman had given it to him. He
spoke of his happiness caused by this simple
gift, then of the beauty of flowers, and of giving;
and, as the audience of 3,000 listened, they
were melted to tears. His subject was the
Accessibility of Christ. It was the <i>tenderness</i>
in his words and voice that wrought the charm.
The singing was general; it seemed that each
of the 3,000 took upon himself the responsibility
of carrying the song through to its conclusion.</p>

<p>In Birmingham, the Carrs visited David
King, editor of the <i>Harbinger</i>; he was the
most prominent member of the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Church in England, of his day. It was his
custom to question the preachers who passed
through his country, to find out if they were
"sound." It was from him that Mr. Carr
discovered the British objection to the American
custom of extending an invitation to the
unsaved at the conclusion of the sermon. It
was also Mr. King who went to the office to
buy the Carrs their tickets up to London,
fearing they would not get second-class ones.
"Only fools and noblemen ride first-class in this
country," was his dictum; "the second class is
just as good and costs half as much."</p>

<p>The following brief notes show us that Mrs.
Carr is in Scotland: "Holyrood&mdash;Rezzio's
Slaughter&mdash;Residence of bygone monarchs&mdash;where
Lord Murray held his Council&mdash;Residence
of Mary Queen of Scots&mdash;where Her Majesty
stops, when in Edinburg&mdash;Castle of Craigmillar&mdash;where
Mary sometimes held her court&mdash;Lochleven
Castle."</p>

<p>She was particularly interested in Wales:
"Canarvon Castle, built by Edward I.&mdash;First
Prince of Wales born here&mdash;April 25, 1284&mdash;Chamberlain
Tower, occupied by the Lord
Chamberlain&mdash;Eagle Tower, so called because

or Dungeon Tower. It is supposed this castle
was never completed. The banqueting hall,

during their visit to Canarvon, April 24. On

<p>All these sights, crowded as they are into a
few days, delay the departure for Australia;
moreover, the travelers have decided to take a
sailship. They have sufficient knowledge of
the deathly throb of the steamer, the quiver
that sends unutterable faintness and nausea to
those susceptible to seasickness. The sailship,
they are told, skims the waves like a bird&mdash;one
hardly knows he is afloat, or knowing, feels
himself lightly carried through the air.</p>

<p>Mrs. Murby finds her new acquaintances have
not left, and writes to Mrs. Carr at Liverpool,
on May 15th, "I was very much pleased to receive
your letter yesterday; I had supposed you
would be far away from Old England by this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
time. I just wish you had stayed with us
longer! There are lots of places besides the
British Museum, I could have taken you to
see. You say you are to leave on Saturday,
the 19th, but the 19th is Tuesday, so we can
hear from each other if we cannot meet. If I
can find that church in Camden Town, for
your sakes I will visit it. The few days we
spent together will always be remembered by
us with pleasure. I sincerely trust we may all
be spared to meet again; you may rest assured
of a hearty welcome. In the meantime we can
correspond with each other. I went to sit for
my portrait yesterday; it will be ready for me
to-morrow, and I will send it to you before you
leave Liverpool."</p>

<p>So writes the editor's wife&mdash;she who finds
primroses in the streets of London; and her
letter comes as a last voice of love to one about
to embark upon a sea-voyage of more than a
hundred days.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>THE LONG VOYAGE.</h3>


<p>The long voyage was made on the
Oriental, Captain Myles. Mrs. Carr
was the only lady who had taken
first-class passage. There was a rich
young man on board, who had been
put under the care of a Scot of mature years;
the young man was peculiarly susceptible to
the temptation of strong drink, but the Captain
reassured his sisters with the declaration
that there would be no drinking aboard his
vessel! The young man wished to visit Australia,
one of the few countries he had never
seen, and Duncan, the Scot, had undertaken
his charge that he, too, might have the treat
of foreign travel.</p>

<p>England had not faded from sight before the
corks were flying.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr found herself associated with a
class of men who were far from corresponding
to the degree of their tickets. She felt the need
of woman's society, since her husband was the
only man present who possessed that refinement
and moral instinct which had been the
breath of her life. She was unable to hide her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
disapproval of the drunken orgies which the
officers of the crew shared, and it was particularly
distressing to her to witness the deliberate
ensnarement of the rich young man, the evident
scheme to make him drink that he might be
fleeced at the card-game.</p>

<p>She and her husband put their sentiments
into words of remonstrance, which resulted in
the Captain's making slighting remarks, as
they sat at table. He took a spiteful pleasure
in boasting in their presence that he wouldn't
employ a "teetotaler on his ship."</p>

<p>The first Sunday out Mr. Carr was asked to
conduct the religious services. He read the
First Psalm and made remarks relative to the
godly and ungodly. Captain Myles was enraged.
"I supposed we would have the Church
of England Service," he said at the conclusion;
"we will have it after this; I will read it, myself."
And so he did, when he was not too
drunk; in that case, he had the ship's physician
read it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr sought relief in the association of
the other women on board, but this was peremptorily
stopped. "If she wants to keep
company with second-class people," said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Captain with a sneer, "let her buy a second-class
ticket."</p>

<p>The ship had not been many days from the
British Isles before the crew was almost completely
demoralized. Drinking, gaming, coarse
songs marked the hours of the night. The
sailors were at the mercy of the winds. The
vessel drifted over to the coast of Africa. It
was becalmed two weeks under the intolerable
heat of the sun's vertical rays, while not a
breath of air came to relieve the hot glare of
the Equator.</p>

<p>One day the Captain exclaimed with the air
of one who has made a terrible decision, "If we
don't get wind to-morrow, I will jump overboard!"
The morrow came, and there was no
wind. Of course the threat of the Captain resulted
in nothing more dangerous than a cooling
bath in the peaceful waters, but the effect
of his words, and of his sudden leap from the
deck, were hard upon sensitive nerves.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr being denied the companionship
of women, found what relief from the monotony
she might, in writing letters, and especially in
writing in her commonplace-book many quotations
from the poets. She beguiled the time,
also, in composing poetry which deals rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
with themes of home, than with those of distant
scenes. The ship was wafted toward South
Africa, but it did not weigh anchor. "The
only view we had of South Africa consisted of
some monkeys in the trees." When the Cape
Verde Islands were sighted, Captain Myles was
anxious to exhibit his skill by passing within a
stone's throw of one on either side. Mrs. Carr,
rejoicing at the sight of something more human
and picturesque than monkeys in trees, took
extensive notes:</p>

<p>"June 18. The Captain caught a large
dolphin&mdash;change of color in dying. Breakfasted
on flying fish.</p>

<p>"June 19. Sighted Antonio and St. Vincent
islands&mdash;passing between them. Cape de
Verde Islands, possessions of Portugese. Antonio
with its innumerable rocky points, some
losing themselves far above the clouds. The
white haze peeping behind, lights up the acute
angles of the points&mdash;the heights are dark,
frowning and barren, with white bowlders at
the feet. The gray terraces in the distance
look like leaping waters, rushing onward to the
ocean, to kiss the breakers. The shores are
dotted with little villages whose houses are
small and white, with red tiled roofs. Around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
these villages are spreading greens along the
shore, and extending up the heights that,
through the glass, are seemingly inaccessible.
Yet these heights are laid out, far up, with
hedges into green fields and waving orchards.
The shore is indented with innumerable little
bays, and the magnificent ravines to which they
point, fill the soul with awe.</p>

<p>"St. Vincent is inhabited by the Portugese,
yet there is not a spring, or well of fresh water,
or a blade of grass in the whole island. There
are the signs, far up the island, of the washing
of the waves. What a glorious sight they
would present in a storm! Here and there, far
up the heights are solitary rocks and vast
strata left bare by the washing of rains and
waves, and blackened by the elements. Signals
are hoisted opposite Porte Grande in order that
the Oriental may be reported in Liverpool in 12
days. Two sailing ships are in the harbor.
The Oriental passed between St. Vincent and
Shell Island."</p>

<p>One day the discovery was made that there
was a stowaway on board; it was a young man
with a crippled arm, who had slipped into a
hiding-place as the Oriental lay at the Liverpool
dock. Captain Myles was all the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
furious because he found himself helpless to rid
himself of the unfortunate youth. He compelled
the stowaway to do the meanest labor,
and the hardest his crippled state would allow.
When the sailors encountered him, they greeted
him with oaths, if they greeted him at all.
He was set to scour the decks, and it was a
task that had no ending.</p>

<p>The Oriental drifted at last into the arms of
the Trade Winds which sent it whirling around
the Cape of Good Hope. A furious storm
came on. The sea was lashed into mountain-peaks
and was hurled in rushing torrents over
the decks. Those sailors who were obliged to
remain above, walked waist-deep in water.
The man at the wheel was tied to his post&mdash;the
Captain was up all night; but not, now, at
cards and drink. The rumor spread among
the passengers that the crew expressed their
doubts of weathering the gale. The rumor
was founded upon truth; the outcome was extremely
doubtful. There was the usual scene
preceding a probable capsizing; curses and
prayers, the sudden scream of agonized fear, or
of desperate appeal. "But we committed ourselves
to the care of the All-wise and Almighty,
and went to sleep."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Morning came to show under its dim light a
battered ship, doors broken open, cabins inundated
from the seas that had poured down
the hatchways, and spars swept away. But
suddenly the ocean grew calm, the wind became
fair, and the vessel headed straight for Australia.</p>

<p>They were at table when the cry arose above,
"Man overboard!" Captain Myers started up
with an oath and went growling and storming
to see into the matter. It was the stowaway,
who had been cast dizzily from the life-boat he
was trying to paint by a sudden lurch of the
vessel. The Captain himself threw him a life-preserver
and shouted, "Stop for him, he's too
crippled to swim to it. Ship about! Man the
life-boat!" In that boat brave sailors went
down out of sight in the angry sea, then like
a bird sat on the crest. Our ship "across sea"
rolled fearfully and the Captain commanded
the passengers to leave the deck. The sailors
in the boat returned, but the poor crippled
boy could not be found. And so the fair wind
bore them on their way and the youth who had
come from the unknown into our story, dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
back again into the unknown. Was there
any one to care?<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>One hundred and four days on the deep,
during which period, land had been sighted
only three times. Mrs. Carr continued to remember,
and to write poetry. We find this,
"Written on board the Oriental, South Atlantic,
August, 1868:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Homeland, dearest, gentle homeland,</span>
<span class="i2">Dearest now art thou to me&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Dearest, for between us stretches,</span>
<span class="i2">Dark and grim, the cruel sea.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I have left thee, home and homeland,</span>
<span class="i2">I have bade thy joys adieu</span>
<span class="i0">But, my heart, my heart is with thee,</span>

<span class="i0">Home and homeland, I have left you;</span>
<span class="i2">"Dear and tender, fare you well!"</span>

</div></div>

<p>Thus after her varied experiences, we find
the young bride's poetic fancy slipping past
the grandeur of the ocean life, its terrible storm
and its terrible calm; she remembers not now
the beautiful castle with its orchid gate, nor
thinks of the family of ten who are to return to
their peasantry in the stately rural life of Old
England; nor of the wonders of the British
Isles; it is Kentucky that claims her deepest
love and sincerest tribute&mdash;And if her ears ring
to the melody of "Old Kentucky Home," a
voice seems to speak, breaking its way through
the music with&mdash;"Go ye into all the world and
preach the gospel to every creature."</p>

<p>At last, the Oriental casts anchor in Hobson's
Bay. The voyage is ended, the experiences
in a foreign land are to begin. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Carrs are urged by many of the second-class
passengers to report the conduct of Captain
Myles, but they let his insolence to them pass
with the passing of unfavorable winds that
have so long delayed the ship. At this entrance
into a new life, they are saddened to
discover that the Captain has persuaded the
rich young man to go back with him&mdash;to refuse
even to land. He has not yet been completely
stripped at the gambling table, and he is so
valuable and tractable a victim, that all arts
are employed to feed his vanity and alienate
him from his guardian. It is a fearful disappointment
to the sturdy Scot, Duncan, to be
deprived of his travels in Australia, but he will
not leave his weak-minded charge; so he turns
his back on the land to see which, he has endured
contumely and abuse, and sails away to
do all he can to save his ward from the Captain's
rapacity&mdash;thus furnishing the Carrs with an
example of fidelity to his promise made to the
sisters of the unfortunate man, which they
treasure in their hearts.</p>

<p>A hundred members of the church have come
from Melbourne to Hobson's Bay, to welcome
the missionaries. Among them, the happiest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
is Oliver's fellow-student at Harrodsburg, G.
L. Surber.</p>

<p>"For many months we have been waiting to
hear if some sacrificing ones would leave the
United States for this country&mdash;" as he and
Gore had left, a few years before. "Then at
last," he writes, "we were rejoiced to hear that
Brother O. A. Carr and wife had left Liverpool
for Melbourne. Our anxiety was to see
them in health. For a fortnight we read the
daily papers eagerly, hoping to hear from them.
At last our suspense was relieved by a telegram&mdash;the
Oriental had entered the Head, which
constitutes the entrance to the port of Melbourne,
about 45 miles from the city. When I
heard the news, I felt as I never felt before.
Now, I thought, my long loneliness is to end,
and the cause of Christ can be more fully met!
I could not help weeping, but it was the weeping
of a rejoicing soul. My brethren in America
do not appreciate their blessings. What
wonder that I, cast, as it were, upon a distant
island, almost alone, should rejoice at the coming
of a co-laborer!"</p>

<p>He continues: "After receiving the telegram,
September 2nd, a number of brethren
with myself went to the port, and took a skiff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and went out to meet them. After rowing
about till nearly sunset, we learned that the
Oriental wouldn't cast anchor till the next day.
So early the next morning we again made our
way to the landing; by this time the brethren
had begun to gather from all parts of the city
and suburbs. At eight o'clock that spring
morning, we went aboard&mdash;" It must be
borne in mind that the Australian spring begins
in September.</p>

<p>"Brother Carr didn't know I was there until
I laid my hand upon his shoulder, and spoke
to him. Picture that meeting, if you can!
Here in this foreign land I grasped the hand of
the dear companion of my school-days! What
thrilling joy! Sister Carr was soon rejoicing
with us. Blessed be our Heavenly Father, for
bringing them safely across the seas!</p>

<p>"After a few moments their luggage was in
our boat and we were rowing to the pier where
we found a throng of brothers and sisters waving
handkerchiefs, and praising God for his
goodness. With what rejoicing the Christians
grasped the hands of the missionaries, as they
stepped on shore! There was no time for introductions,
none waited for that; but such a
shaking of hands, and welcoming of Brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and Sister Carr, was enough to move the angels
to rejoice. In a few minutes they had
taken the train for the city; then in a cab I
took them to my residence, where they are now
resting from their hardships, soothed by the
climate, and delighting, after months upon the
deep, in the bloom of peach and plum, and the
blossoming of our spring gardens."</p>

<p>Thus G. L. Surber writes home that Benj.
Franklin of the Christian Church may publish
the letter; thus he writes, until he corrects and
polishes up the sentences, changing his "We
made our way to the landing" to&mdash;"we turned
our faces," etc. and scratching out "waving
handkerchiefs" for something about "open
hearts." But we make nothing of his careful
remoulding of ideas, nor give a snap for his
"open heart." The handkerchiefs shall wave
in this history&mdash;let them stream to the breeze,
each a white fluttering banner of peace and
love, raised above the heads of this vanguard
of Christian soldiers, this beautiful spring
morning of September 3rd, 1868.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>LIFE IN MELBOURNE.</h3>


<p>The Carrs were formally welcomed to
Melbourne, the evening of the day on
which they landed, by a church tea
meeting. We shall speak of it in detail,
that a general notion may be
gleaned of this popular Australian church
social.</p>

<p>"Tea on the Tables at Half-past Six," is the
way the invitation-cards read. We assemble
in the basement. There are four tables, running
the entire length of the Chapel (we are
not to say "church" when speaking of a house.)
Not alone is tea "on the tables." Here we
find a bountiful repast, garnished forth with
beautiful flowers fresh from our gardens.</p>

<p>After tea, we present the flowers to our
guests of honor. By eight o'clock we have
eaten, shaken hands, talked informally with
every one, and are ready to adjourn to the
auditorium. Here we listen to the Chairman's
address, and the addresses of five others, including
O. A. Carr and G. L. Surber. The
congregation sings three hymns, the Singing
Class renders another; we have, also, two anthems,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and, after the benediction, feel that we
have been to a Tea Meeting, indeed.</p>

<p>A few years ago, the Cause in Australia was
very weak. Now the pressing need is laborers.
The Melbourne Church is strong enough to
divide; Surber will preach at the Chapel; a hall
will be rented for $400 in gold, in which O. A.
Carr will preach; thus forming a nucleus in two
remote points in the great city. The speakers
at the tea meeting are strong in their faith,
and with good reason. Last year the church
gave for home and foreign missions, and local
expenses, $4000 in gold.</p>

<p>We have never had any trouble with expenses,
because each of us does something&mdash;each
one! that is our secret of success. Far
away in Adelaide, Gore and Earl are laboring;
here in Melbourne, Carr and Surber&mdash;four
evangelists for Australia. But, as we shall see,
all the preaching is not done by the evangelists.
And what of Mrs. Carr? At this very first
tea meeting we speak of a school for Sister
Carr. "We expect in a few months to see
her devoting all her time to the high calling of
teaching."</p>

<p>Thus the new work is inaugurated. Not for
the writer is the labor of seeking lodgings, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
house which will serve also as a school; not for
the reader the weary days of forming an establishment,
of settling down to the necessary
routine of daily living, of forming grooves in
which one may run automatically, the better to
give the mind to higher things than food and
a roof.</p>

<p>We are in a land where all is strange and
new; but when we leave it, all shall have become
familiar, and much of it dear. The reader
need but glance along the peaks that rise
out of the level plain of daily experiences&mdash;one
tea meeting for him, to fifty for the Carrs; a
few characters to be learned from among the
thousands who cross the paths of the young
missionaries.</p>

<p>One might crowd a large book with the people
who come and go, never to return, people
important in their own orbits, no doubt, but
quite futile to ours. Happy would it be for
us and ours, if all the time we scatter among
the moving multitudes of life, we might concentrate
upon the few who are to abide in our
hearts and memory. But that is not to be
while life is life; however, it may be reasonably
accomplished in book-land.</p>

<p>So, of these hundreds and hundreds of letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
before me, whose signatures are but the
labels of so many shadows&mdash;impersonal spirits
who did nothing but write and vanish&mdash;we can
select only those of a few men who seem to
breathe the same air that envelops our principal
characters.</p>

<p>Such a breathing reality appears in John
Augustus Williams, so real in his profound
faith in the dignity of teaching, that the chalk-dust
seems to swing above his head as a sort
of material halo.</p>

<p>To him we find Mrs. Carr writing: "We
reached Melbourne in early September, after a
long voyage of 104 days! Contrary winds kept
us in the Irish Channel a fortnight; but we
kept our spirits up, resolved to be content-subjects
of the winds. We drifted within sight of
the South American shores. We sailed many
miles along the mango and palm-wreathed
coast of Brazil. We are well and ready for
work. Brother Surber was very happy to see
us, and the church gave us a most cordial
greeting. I will write brother Joe a description
of the voyage; you can exchange letters with
him. I enclose a little flower and leaf of woodruff.
I plucked it at the foot of the south
tower of the royal entrance to Canarvon Castle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
on Menia Straits, opposite Anglesey. In that
castle, the first prince of Wales was born,
April 25, 1284."</p>

<p>T. J. Gore writes to the newcomers from
Adelaide, South Australia: "I am aware of
your arrival in Melbourne. You do not know
how I long to see you both&mdash;you come from old
Kentucky&mdash;may Heaven's richest blessings rest
upon that dear state! It is hard to realize that
here so near, are two live Kentuckians from my
far-away home. You will find conditions and
customs very different here from America; but
it is the Lord's harvest; moreover, Melbourne
contains a great many Americans; here in Adelaide,
my eyes are hardly ever blessed by the
sight of one, but I console myself with the
thought that though I am far from my native
land I am still in the Kingdom of the Lord.
No doubt you and Surber are now talking
over days of long ago, at Kentucky University.</p>

<p>"Brother Carr! how I should love to fold
you to my heart! Tell Sister Carr she need
not fear the hot winds; they are quite harmless.
Brother Earl preaches to big audiences Sunday
evening at White's Assembly room; he has not
found a church yet. Tell Sister Carr she deserves
great credit for leaving her home, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
coming so far, all for the sake of His Word.
My thoughts go to Keith in Louisville, and
Albert Myles in Cincinnati. I wish we had an
evangelist in New Zealand. Write me something
for the <i>Pioneer</i>" (which he is editing).
"Brother Santo wishes you both much happiness
and great success." (Gore has found a
sweetheart,&mdash;"Brother Santo's" daughter;
which gives him a firmer position from which
to protest against homesickness.)</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the first sermon preached
by O. A. Carr in Australia, two made the
good confession. During his ministry in the
colonies, he found conversions the rule, while
the exception became rarer and rarer, of preaching
without visible results. He had not found
a house to rent when a letter was received from
one who was to take an interesting part in his
life&mdash;Thomas Magarey, an Englishman, who
had settled in Southern Australia:</p>

<p>"Now that you are enjoying a little relaxation
from the call of visitors upon your arrival,
I may venture an epistle of congratulation upon
your safe arrival. May you and Sister Carr be
spared to present the old and glorious Gospel.
I read your article in the <i>Review</i>, and laughed
at the alarm of the church at Birmingham, lest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
any one should 'drop a penny in their collection.'
We have very little cause for alarm upon
that score, here in South Australia. I have
heard that you both are suffering from homesickness.
I had that complaint for about
twenty years.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, every one in Australia has
suffered from it more or less and, like seasickness,
it meets with no sympathy. I never could
understand why the most disheartening of complaints
should receive no commiseration, but so
it is. I cannot think your disease very violent,
for the best authorities say, those love home
best who have least reason to do so. Thus the
Irishman suffers more from leaving his land of
potatoes than the Englishman his beef and
plum pudding. I need not tell you that the
best remedy is constant employment. This is
not our home&mdash;we are all pilgrims and strangers.
My son, just now, was instructing his little
brothers and sisters upon Astronomy. I
heard him say that from Jupiter, this earth of
ours could not be seen. Humiliating thought!"</p>

<p>The man who writes thus abruptly, treading
upon the tender susceptibilities of Kentucky
pilgrims, calls for more than passing mention.
When hundreds flocked to the Australian gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
fields, Thomas Magarey established a mill, and
sold flour to the prospectors. Gold was found
in abundance, and easily parted with; but while
others dug it from the earth, Magarey ground
his meal and watched the yellow tide as it came
his way. "Twenty years of homesickness," on
his part, was well rewarded. He owned a
palatial home in South Australia, was immensely
wealthy, and was a Member of Parliament.</p>

<p>His religious life was diverted into its present
channel by reading articles by Alexander Campbell
and Walter Scott in the <i>Christian Baptist</i>.
His brother, some time before the coming of
the Carrs to Australia, perished in a fire at sea.
Thomas took his brother's family into his own
home, where all live as one. His sheep ranch,
his cattle, his horses, his milling business, his
civic affairs, occupied the greater part of the
day, but his evenings were spent with his wife
and children.</p>

<p>On Sundays two carriages took them to
church in the morning, to Sunday-school in the
afternoon, to preaching at night. At the Governor's
receptions, the jewels of the Magareys
flashed with the costliest; at church, their garments
were as simple as the simplest. And if
there was no preacher, as indeed was usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the case in this land where preachers were so
scarce, Thomas Magarey addressed the congregation,
after the Australian manner.</p>

<p>The better to understand this manner, let
us return to the Carrs, and take a brief view
of their religious life. As we have seen, the
preacher delivered a sermon only on Sunday
nights. The primary object of the Sunday
morning service was the observance of the
Lord's Supper. For the Church of Christ, in
its desire to do just as the Christians did in
Apostolic times, met on the first day of the
week to break bread, not "to keep the Sabbath
day holy", which they said had been done
away, with the old dispensation, but to celebrate
the resurrection of Christ.</p>

<p>Besides the communion service on Sunday
morning, there would be exhortations to religious
life by laymen, who had been appointed
a month in advance. These men took pride in
preparing brief addresses which they hoped
might prove edifying; and so general was the
custom, that if the minister failed to be present,
his absence was unfelt. Such a custom tended
to build up a permanent and fervid religious
sentiment in the very heart of the congregation&mdash;a
speaking Christianity which business men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
carried during the week into their shops and
offices.</p>

<p>The congregation would assemble promptly
in the morning, and, a minute or two before
eleven o'clock, would sit with bowed heads.
Exactly at eleven, all would rise to their feet,
and lift up some familiar hymn such as "Safely
through another week, God has brought us on
our way." Among the five hundred there
were not a dozen silent mouths. Following
the hymn, a chapter would be read from the Old
Testament, another from the New. A third
layman would announce a hymn, usually reading
it; a fourth would lead in prayer. Still
another would preside at the table, to be followed
by those appointed for short addresses.</p>

<p>The congregation preferred to take business
affairs from their own number, rather than
from the minister. As an example&mdash;One morning
a man rose and said: "Since I have been
hearing Brother Carr preach, my Bible has become
a new Bible. I never understood it till
now. But there is one subject Brother Carr
has omitted&mdash;the duty and privilege of financially
supporting the preacher." Having delivered
himself upon this neglected theme, the
man concluded: "You know me and my circumstances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
I am a shipwright. I will give
half a crown a week. My wife will do the same.
There are many present who can do as well.
Now, will you do it?" And the audience rose
and said, "We will do it!"</p>

<p>Before a house had been selected for the
missionaries, Mrs. Carr went on a visit to some
new-found friends; as a result we have a series
of letters between her and Mr. Carr; we trust
our extracts from them will be both judicious
and interesting.</p>

<p>Mr. Carr to Mrs. Carr: "If my writing
proves obscure, remember I'm an obscure person
in this country. Brother Magarey left for
Ballarat. We all went with him to the depot.
Alex. and Vaney" (Magarey's sons) "could
hardly keep from crying when they saw their
father leave." (Alex. and Vaney are to board
with the Carrs in order to finish the course at
the University of Melbourne.) "I went to look
at that house in Clarendon Terrace, but behold,
it was let when I got there! However, the
owner said he wouldn't have been willing to
have you teach a school in it; and besides, it
would have been too far out for the boys (Alex.
and Vaney) to walk. There will be plenty of
houses to rent when the people go to the seaside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
for the summer." (By which we mean
December).</p>

<p>"We must wait a little longer and be satisfied.
I trust in God. We are to do a great
work here, if we will be humble and abide
the Lord's will. One confession at chapel, today,
five at the hall. There are very large
audiences. Your class did well. They seemed
much disappointed in not seeing you, but they
didn't come right out and say they preferred
you as their teacher&mdash;mighty smart girls!
Brother Zelius says I must remember him to
you." ("Brother Zelius'" was the first house
the Carrs entered on landing at Melbourne; it
was he who had sent O. A. Carr the money to
come from America. Years before, Zelius had
stood penniless, save for one shilling, and entirely
unknown, in the streets of Melbourne;
but he had done well since he heard and accepted
the doctrine as presented by the Christians,
and it was natural that he should have a
proprietary interest in his missionaries.)<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>
<p>Mrs. Carr to Mr. Carr: "We reached Nutcundria
last evening in safety. The day is intensely
hot" (November 29). "I do not believe
I could ever love the Australian climate. Give
me the sunny and starlit skies, the balmy
breezes, the snows and winter winds of old
Kentucky! There is abundance of ripe fruit
here. Couldn't you come for me next week?
The trip can be made in a day. I shall never
regret placing my heart in your keeping; for
every day, I see a new light shining in your
character."</p>

<p>Mr. Carr to Mrs. Carr: "Joy came this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
morning in the shape of a letter apiece; yours
from brother Joe, which, I see, came by way of
Panama. Mine is from sister Minnie&mdash;her
news has touched and thrilled my inmost soul:
Jimmie has obeyed the Gospel; and dear old
father, working hard all day, and going to
prayer-meeting at night! Poor mother! I wish
it were so that she could attend oftener. Vaney,
Alex. and I were at the hall last night.
Alex. announced the hymns for me. Vaney
says they would take me for a Catholic priest if
it were not for my whiskers. Vaney is always
cutting at me&mdash;we have a good deal of fun as
we go along. Say! I would like to see you
monstrous well! If you stay up there much
longer please send me a lock of your hair! I
have a house in view&mdash;3 stories, 8 good rooms,
just behind Fitzroy Garden, near corner of
Clarendon and George streets, price 130
pounds. All rates paid. This house is beautifully
situated; from it you can view the Botanical
Garden, the Bay, Emerald Hill, etc., but it
is a long walk from chapel. I have spent about
3 hours in preparing a lecture for the class, tonight"
(we will hear more about that class a little
later.)</p>

<p>Mr. Carr again: "Two confessions at chapel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
3 at the hall. The work is going gloriously
on. I baptized 10 Friday night. I am very
busy. There is great excitement. The Rev.
Mr. Ballantyne has issued a tract on baptism.
The brethren want me to reply as soon as possible,
(presenting arguments for immersion).
I ought to get out the tract in 10 days, so I
cannot come up for you. If Miss McIntyre
will come down in coach with you, I will take
pleasure in helping her on the way to heaven;
but I cannot come next week. We have no
house yet. Brother and Sister Zelius send
love."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr, to Mr. Carr: "I walked out this
evening to meet you, and was disappointed.
Soon after, I received your letter; of course I
approve your conscientious course of conduct.
I do not ask your <i>best</i> love, Ollie, that belongs
to God; I ask only its reflex. Your fealty to
our Savior is the foundation-stone upon which
my affection is built, sure and firm. How
strong is my faith that that foundation-stone
will ever stand! Next to my faith in Jesus, it
brings me the sweetest consolation. I loved you
better than my brother, for I left him to follow
you; but I am learning more and more each
day, how much better. God knows how my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
heart yearns toward my dear brothers and sisters;
but you are dearer to me, Ollie, than all
the world beside. In reply to Mr. Ballantyne,
studiously avoid all offense; that which offends
will never convince. May God bless your efforts
for the promulgation of the Truth."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<span class="caption">Favorite Walk Toward Barclay Terrace</span>
</div>

<p>"Last Friday morning we started to the
Spur, an offshoot of the Dandenon. The
scenery along its sides and summit, is the most
beautiful in Victoria. The gorges filled with
enormous pines, stately grottos, and gums,
and peppermints, are a rich feast to the aesthetic
nature&mdash;but I saw nothing that so stirred
the depths of my soul, as the dreamy hills in
autumn along the magnificent Ohio. About
40 miles below the Spur we found good accommodations
at Heyfield, which we enjoyed after
the long jolting ride.</p>

<p>"We rose at five the next morning to visit the
Falls on the Thompson. Their beauty fully
paid us for our mile's walk&mdash;it seemed three to
me. The Falls are magnificent, the lower
plunging from 50 to 100 feet, the highest from
200 feet. We made our way with considerable
difficulty along the whole face of the Falls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
We had to cling to the saplings to keep from
rolling headlong into the river. I had a severe
headache that morning, and kept my hair hanging,
and the bush was so very thick, I wonder
I did not share the fate of Absalom. I hope
you will get us a house as soon as possible; I
am anxious to have a home of our own&mdash;if that
is possible in a foreign land. I hear that Mr.
Surber is going to New Zealand. May God
bless you, my dear husband, that you may
bring many into the Kingdom."</p>

<p>Shortly after Mrs. Carr's return to her husband,
they received another letter from their
fellow-countryman, T. J. Gore, who is still
afraid they may succumb to homesickness.
The manner in which he argues against such
a feeling, is very philosophical: "Our home
beyond the bright blue sea is lovely; there a
father and mother are longing to lay their arms
about our necks and say, 'Welcome home!'
What a happy meeting that would be!&mdash;but
not to be compared to the welcome into everlasting
arms. Brother Carr, we are going
home&mdash;we have already embarked&mdash;we <i>are</i> on
the ship, the good old ship, and swiftly we are
speeding over the waves of life. We have met
a few storms, but the Captain said, 'Peace be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
still.' The barometer has been low, but He
said, 'There's no danger in this ark of safety!'
God only lent us our little homes among the
hills of Kentucky; it is true they are dear to us;
but in a few years He will lend them to others
of whom we know nothing."</p>

<p>A sentence farther on explains, perhaps, how
the writer can be so calmly philosophical:
"You have, of course, heard that I am married.
Mrs. Gore begs to be remembered to
you; we cannot be as strangers: You and Sister
Carr must come over (to Adelaide) to see
us soon."</p>

<p>Letters from home may have accented the
stress of home-longing, but others came that
gave heart for the long separation, such as
the following from Mrs. Drusie Ellis of Ghent,
Ky.; "Last night, I heard of your safe arrival
in Australia. I loaned the paper containing
your letters to a friend. She brought it
back with the remark that she could scarcely
keep from tears while reading it,&mdash;and, as I
told Doctor, <i>'Scarcely</i> keep from crying, indeed!'&mdash;when
I could not even <i>mention</i> the
subject in a steady voice! The thought of
your wife so nobly giving up home and country
for the great work touches my heart deeply. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
read of her welcome with streaming tears, and
determined to write this word of Christian
sympathy, hoping to add one little thrill of joy
to hearts so truly consecrated."</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Carr decided to rent the house
already mentioned, in Barclay Terrace. It
commanded an extensive view of Fitzroy Gardens,
through which they walked every day.
The way into the heart of the city led among its
statues and greeneries. One might sink down
to rest on the benches beside the fountains, or
loiter on the rustic bridges,&mdash;only, alas! there
was little time for loitering!&mdash;inhale the fragrance
of the perennial flowers, and take a look
at Diana and the Stag before setting forth for
Chapel. From the bandstand ascended, "God
save the Queen," to the Southern Cross. Who
shall say what element of charm did not steal
unconsciously from such beautiful surroundings
into the hearts of the missionaries?</p>

<p>We have said there was little time for loitering;
the reader shall be the judge. Two nights
in the week were devoted to the prayer meetings
of the two churches; one night was devoted to
those who came to Barclay Terrace to inquire
after the truth, or to learn Christian duty; a
fourth night every week was the lecture-night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
at the Collinwood Church&mdash;the Church established
by Mr. Carr; on Friday night there was
a short sermon and then the baptizing of those
who had already inquired after the truth and
made the good confession, and who had been
instructed as to the purpose of baptism, and
what would be expected of the subject as to attendance
at church, contributing, and the governing
of one's household.</p>

<p>As the weeks passed by, the history of the
Friday nights presented the appearance of continuous
"protracted meeting." Rarely, if
ever, did a week pass without the application
and acceptance of from one to twenty members.
Nor did those who joined the one body, the
church, enter upon the crest of an excitement-wave,
or with a superficial notion of what it
meant to be a Christian. The following note
will show that converts were not to be obtained
with undue haste:</p>

<p>"The following was passed at the Business
Meeting of 23rd March, 1869: 'That this
Meeting considers it inexpedient for our
Evangelists to invite public confessions, seeing
they regard it desirable to have conversation
before baptism.'"</p>


<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">"Church Secretary."</span></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the work already indicated, there was
an "Improvement Class" each week, composed
of young members of the church, who read essays,
and made short talks, to be criticised by
the minister. From this class were selected
those who addressed the congregation on Sunday
morning. These young men were closely
bound by affection to their leader, Mr. Carr.
There was something perennially young in his
own bosom, that responded to their youth.</p>

<p>His health was delicate, as it had been in
Lexington, and the never-relaxing labors of every
night in the week, might have made another
prematurely old and solemn. But his boarders,
Alex. and Vaney Magarey, could have told
of many a time when he slipped to the attic
with them for a hasty game of marbles. Such
innocent, though clandestine sport, heartened
him up, no doubt, to deal the more telling
blows against ecclesiastical foes. Who in reading
his trenchant arguments on the subject of
Baptism, would have suspected that at that
very moment the marbles might be clinking in
his pocket!<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>
<p>No wonder the young men felt his spirit akin
to their own! After prayer-meeting they would
walk with him "part of the way,&mdash;" which
usually extended quite across the fifty acres of
Fitzroy Gardens, and up to his very door.
And as they walked they talked, talked with
all the earnestness of youth, when youth is in
earnest.</p>

<span class="caption">Waiting in Melbourne alone. Will go to Hobart</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>One night when the conversation had become
unusually absorbing they stopped and, looking
up, found they had halted before the Model
School Building,&mdash;which corresponds to an
American college. The subject of acquiring an
education had often engaged them before, but
now ideas came to a focus.</p>

<p>"I have a calf, and some carpenter's tools,"
said one young man, addressing Mr. Carr
earnestly; "I will sell them, and buy clothes
and books if you will teach me."</p>

<p>Without hesitation the minister cried, "Come
on."</p>

<p>"May we come too?" chorused the others.</p>

<p>"Yes!" Little did they realize how much
that consent meant; how much of energy, of
which there was no surplus; how much of nerve-drain
and anxious thought. A number of
young men decided to come to Barclay Terrace
every day. They came and Mr. Carr gave
them the same course he had taken at Kentucky
University. This was, indeed, paying
back to the world with interest, the good that
the world had bestowed! When Eneas Myall
carried to Carr's tavern the money that started
Oliver Carr on his road to the University, little
did he dream of the beneficent influences he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
was setting in motion on the other side of the
globe! It is so with every good deed. One
never sows a word of love beneath the northern
skies, but he may find it blooming some day,
beneath the Southern Cross.</p>

<p>Mr. Carr's boys had studied some&mdash;not much&mdash;at
the public school. They knew something
of English grammar; he did not teach it to
them; he taught Greek grammar, and it is
needless to say that they became good grammarians.
They read the New Testament in
Greek. They were taught rhetoric and logic
from Mr. Carr's notes, taken at the University.
Among the class was that T. H. Rix, who is
today a successful evangelist. Another&mdash;he
who sold his calf and tools to buy books,&mdash;stands
today as the best educated man in the
Church of Christ, in Australia, next to T. J.
Gore. He is G. B. Moysey. Who will say
he would better have kept his calf?</p>

<p>Thus we find O. A. Carr becomes a schoolteacher,
though his purposes were all set otherwise.
It seemed forced upon him by his consciousness
of the good he might do. We are to
find the same thing occurring again and again
in his life. Duty seemed ever calling him to the
desk when his own heart yearned for the pulpit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
As yet he was able&mdash;both to preach and
teach with all his might. Unfortunately that
might was not based upon physical resources.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Mrs. Carr must always
teach, wherever she was, because teaching was
a part of her being. She had opened a class
for young ladies in her home. Her accommodations
compelled her to limit the number of
pupils to about twenty; but, on account of this
limitation, she was enabled to select those girls
who were most refined, and who promised the
best spiritual reward for her labors. This was
her second school; and while it was by no
means so pretentious as her college at Lancaster,
the results were doubtless more far-reaching.</p>

<p>Her system of education,&mdash;indeed, her conception
of education&mdash;differed materially from
that found in Melbourne. If her method
seemed radical to the most conservative, it filled
with delight those open to impressions of new
truth. Mrs. Carr's scheme to educate a
girl was not to fill her with facts, but to develop
her mind and heart. This has not always
been understood by those who patronized
her various schools. The commonplace test of
"how much a pupil knows," did not always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
apply to her classes. She took pains to teach
them how to preserve their health, how to deport
themselves, how to preserve their modesty
and integrity, how to become forces in the
world.</p>

<p>In a word, she did not labor to root in those
tender minds a multitude of facts which the
passing of time sweeps away; it was her desire
to form of each impressionable girl, a noble
woman.</p>

<p>It was her conviction that no higher work
exists in the world than the development of
high ideals of womanhood. If she could have
reached young girls in any other way, in daily
living, she could have dispensed altogether
with the school.</p>

<p>The school was but a means to the end of
shaping lives. There were, perhaps, girls in
Melbourne at that time, who were learning
more facts than Mrs. Carr's girls were learning;
who might, it may be, have answered
with greater exactitude if questioned as to the
dimensions of the planets' orbits, or as to the
geological eons.</p>

<p>These things did not seem to her of supreme
importance. What to her mind, mattered,
was to make world-blessings of her girls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
This was so deep a conviction of her soul, that
she had little patience with literalism.</p>

<p>It is necessary to understand her purpose, in
order to comprehend the relationship between
her and her pupils. When Mrs. Carr found
in any girl those true and enduring qualities
which, however much neglected, promise a harvest
of love, and gratitude, and noble deeds,
and thoughts, there were no pains too great
for her to take, to develop that soul.</p>

<p>But when it was her lot to be thrown with a
girl whose life-purposes were all antagonistic
to the sphere of the cultured woman&mdash;a girl
who suspected insincere motives, and watched
for faults, and hardened herself against sweet
influences, Mrs. Carr felt that she could do
more good by giving her time to more susceptible
spirits.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that the pupil who
reached after the higher standards of life,
found Mrs. Carr a woman of motherly tenderness;
while she who drew back, found her cold
and unsympathetic.</p>

<p>It is difficult to learn the real character of
any teacher from her pupils, unless we take
into consideration the character and point of
view of those interrogated. The pupil in sympathy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
with the instructress will praise her, one
in rebellion will blame her. It seems necessary
to say this, because Mrs. Carr has often been
misunderstood and misrepresented. An obdurate
and intractable pupil usually has a family
to espouse her view of the case; and the
neighbors share the impression of the family;
and visiting guests share the opinions of the
neighbors.</p>

<p>It is not always that the pupil wilfully misrepresents;
indeed, in most cases, she does not
intentionally do so; but she cannot understand,
because her heart is not in accord. It would
be a strange thing if any teacher should be universally
praised by her pupils, and the suspicion
would inevitably arise that she had not done
her full duty.</p>

<p>On one point all of Mrs. Carr's pupils are
agreed; that she was a splendid disciplinarian.
Whether you loved her or feared her, or disliked
her, she made you keep good order while
under her instruction.</p>

<p>As to her success in school work at Melbourne,
we shall content ourselves with letting
the consul speak a good word for her, then relate
a little incident.</p>

<p>Geo. R. Latham to Mrs. Carr: "Knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the respectable character of the colleges in the
United States of which you are a graduate, and
feeling a lively appreciation of your thorough
education, finished accomplishments, and intellectual
and moral worth, and learning that you
have opened a select school for young ladies in
this city (Melbourne) I most gladly consent to
the use of my name as reference."</p>

<p>The terms per quarter for board and tuition
were from 18-18-0 to 10-10-0. Mrs. Carr
taught the following: "English Literature,
Mathematics, Natural Science and all English
branches usually taught, Italian, French, German,
Pianoforte, Guitar, Drawing and Painting,
Leather Work, Wax Flowers." She was
the only teacher and, we may conclude, had her
hands full!</p>

<span class="caption">Port Elliott&mdash;Farthest Point South</span>
</div>

<p>The anecdote we referred to, related to one
of Mrs. Carr's pupils, Ettie Santo. Her father,
Philip Santo, lived in South Australia. He
was a member of Parliament;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and a rich iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
monger. He dealt largely in imported agricultural
implements. He had the same love of
family that Thomas Magarey exhibited; every
day at three he would go out to his splendid
residence in the suburbs, and play an hour with
his children. Then after exercising, he would
go to the library. After tea he wrote and read
two hours, then assembled the family for Bible-reading
and prayer. Ettie boarded with Mrs.
Carr. It was the first time she had stayed
away from home. She was a very quiet, undemonstrative
girl. Her father came to Melbourne
to visit her. One day he showed Mrs.
Carr a letter he had received from his daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
before his arrival. In the body of the letter
was this sentence:</p>

<p>"Father, I love you; I have never told you
so; I can write it better than I can speak it."</p>

<p>This is narrated as an illustration of Mrs.
Carr's educational ideas. To bring love into
being; or, as in the case of this noble-minded
girl, where love already existed, to give that
love a voice&mdash;to teach faithful service and
strengthen holy aspirations, these were her imparted
lessons. The soul which could not receive
them might be hardened against her, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
nevertheless she sowed the seed; with her,
teaching was a religious exercise.</p>

<p>At this busy time, while Mrs. Carr had her
girls, and Mr. Carr his boys, to say nothing of
a thousand outside duties to be performed, a
character entered their lives like a good fairy.
Janie Rainey was born and reared in Scotland.
Her sister married a "gentleman" that is to
say, a man of means, and for a time Janie lived
with them. But it soon became borne in upon
her that her brother-in-law looked upon her as
a burden to his household. She knew a Presbyterian
minister in Melbourne, who, in answer
to her letter, encouraged her to come to Australia,
where she could find plenty of work.
She made the long voyage, and found asylum
in his house, until she should find regular employment.</p>

<p>One day she appeared at the house in Barclay
Terrace. Beneath her sunbonnet was to
be seen a bright face, and shrewd yet kindly
eyes. As she sat in the hall in her plain but
scrupulously neat dress, Mrs. Carr was
charmed by her Scotch accent, and by her
manner of dignified dependence. Janie explained
that she had heard Mrs. Carr needed a
servant; she had come to keep the house for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
her, to wash, to cook, to do anything. She
was received with joy. As Mrs. Carr afterward
said, "It was love at first sight."</p>

<p>Before the Carrs came to Melbourne, Janie
had gone to hear Mr. Surber preach. "The
first time I heard him," she said, "I knew it
didn't sound like the kirk! I could understand
him; it was so <i>plain</i>!" When she had heard
him preach about half a dozen times, she said,
"I must confess my faith!" She became an
intelligent Christian. She knew a great part
of the Bible by heart. "I have read the New
Testament all my life," she declared, "and
never knew what it meant before."</p>

<p>Janie worked for the Carrs all the time they
staid in Melbourne. She regularly attended
the Sunday services, the prayer meetings, and
the other gatherings of the church. From her
wages she gave one shilling every Sunday
morning. She read the church papers and the
daily papers while the Carrs and their boarders
were at breakfast. Her room was kept
clean and inviting, and a talk with her was refreshing;
seldom did a preacher visit the house,
who did not ask to see Janie.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr would sit in the kitchen to hear
Janie read "Bobbie Burns," with the proper accent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
The servant had seen the places described
in the poems; she had known people
who had known the poet. She knew anecdotes
about him that have never seen the print. She
told about a working girl who, on looking into
his room, found him stamping upon the floor,
and rushing back and forth like mad; how she
had rushed down stairs crying, "He's daft!"&mdash;how
Burns on hearing the cry exclaimed,
"<i>'Daft!</i>' the very word I was trying to think
of!"&mdash;and how he slapped his knees, and fell
to writing.</p>

<p>It was Janie's delight to take care of Mr.
and Mrs. Carr,&mdash;to stand between them and
those innumerable details of daily life, that sap
the energies, that waste the time, and ward off
the essential objects of life for those who have
no Janies.</p>

<p>"She would go to market seeking to tempt
our appetites. She would say, 'Oh, you don't
eat enough to keep a bird alive!' She petted
us. No one regarded her as a servant except
herself&mdash;but she always held herself to be one.
She was, indeed, more of a companion. A
beautiful character&mdash;one who did her duty because
it <i>was</i> duty, and who loved us till we felt
that she was one of the family. Her disposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
was bright and cheerful. We often found
her reading while the kettle boiled, or going
about her work with an open book propped upon
the kitchen table. One day I went into the
kitchen and found her laughing outright.
'What is it, Janie?' 'Oh, I was laughing at
what Mark Twain says about the Turkish bath!'
What ever concerned us seemed as sacred in
her eyes as a religious matter, and she would
guard it as her own interests. Hers was a life
in which we could see no fault."</p>

<p>A high testimonial to one who serves for
years in one's kitchen! A testimonial rarely
given, rarely merited. Let this be an excuse,
if one is needed, for giving so much space to
the simple maid from Scotland. Here is one
whose soul bursts through the vapors of false
pride and unlovely shame that does so much to
soil the beauty of the poor. Here is one who
recognizes the dignity of service, and who
shows by humble acts that mark each hour,
she loves her neighbor as herself.</p>

<p>And now that we have one so efficient and
willing to admit the visitors, to cook the meals
and to do the washing, let us retire to the
library and, without fear of interruption, enjoy
a sheaf of letters, which lie before us; not, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
drinking them to the very lees, but sipping
here and there. Our word for it, if the
reader be in the mood for mail-opening, he
shall not go unrewarded.</p>

<p>Here is a young man writing from the Agricultural
College of Kentucky University, whom
Carr and Surber have evidently advised to
go thither for a Christian education: "I suppose
when I told you I would come here to
school, you thought I would never come.
After hard work I got to England, and I
worked hard before I got here; but when there
is a craving for an education, no toil or labor
will hinder that young man. I come to study
the scriptures, to be able to go into the world
to preach the Gospel. I work five hours in the
A. &amp; M. College on the farm, and the machine
shop. I got to this place without one cent of
money. What do you think my first work
here was? Dropping potatoes&mdash;Sir; yes, sir!"</p>

<p>J. B. Myers to Mrs. Carr: "I promised to
tell you about the changes in Lancaster," (from
which we may glean a little local coloring of
Mattie's old home.) "The railroad runs right
by the old Methodist church, out by the cemetery;
indeed, it took away one corner of the old
brick building. The passenger depot is on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Crab Orchard pike." (Then he enumerates all
the new houses on the various pikes, tells what
girls are going to "set out," and remarks that
he pays more attention to ladies since his sister's
departure.)</p>

<p>"I am still in the old room over Brother
Sweeney's store! I have furnished it up with
a $30 bookcase, etc. I have resigned my position
in the Male Academy to teach a public
school no more forever! I can't live that way&mdash;too
much time consumed in watching the
pupils, and making them keep order,&mdash;and the
rest of my time, too worried to throw my soul
into the work, and give efficient instruction. I
begin a private class of about 20 choice boys,
right away." Then about some who have
died; some who have married; a foolish young
girl who has kept her marriage a secret; and a
poor gentleman who is growing too fleshy, and
the fond hope that&mdash;"When you and Ollie
come back to old Kentucky, you must keep
house, and I will board with you!" "A year
of your absence is about gone. May the three
pass speedily! Yea, let them all pass rapidly
that you and Ollie may be returned to me.
How I love you my dearest sister! Tell Ollie I
love him; too, and am proud of him!" (Very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
different does Brother Joe talk, now that he
no longer stands hatless upon the pike, stopping
our stage coach!)</p>

<p>Here is a letter from our blacksmith, Eneas
Myall: "I would not think of writing to you;
but I know what it is to be far from home,
and the pleasure of receiving a letter when
among strangers; and besides, it is my duty to
answer your letter. I regret very much that
you did not get to see any of my folks when
you were in England. I wish you could see
more of England. I am satisfied it is the
greatest opening for primitive Christianity in
the world. Ollie, this will be rather a broken
letter as I am talking, selling and writing all
at the same time. We are getting along religiously,
as well as common. It looks a little odd
to see your father and mother attending church;
but we are all glad to see it. Your father is
always in his place, and so is your mother,
when she can get there. And let me tell you,
you are not forgotten in our prayers. We
hardly ever have a meeting that you are not
bidden God's speed. Brother Bartholomew
of Philadelphia was here, raising money to sustain
a missionary in that city! Not very many
were present, so our contribution of $60 was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
quite liberal, I assure you. Our envelope system
is working-well." (Introduced into May's
Lick Church by O. A. Carr, who visited personally
every member and gave each fifty-two
envelopes in which to place the promised weekly
offering for a year).</p>

<p>"And now, Ollie, as I am about to close&mdash;if
we meet never again here, let us meet in Heaven.
Let us be faithful to our God. My faith bids
me go forward in the unshirking discharge of
my duty, and the promise will be mine. All
the Myalls send their love to you and your lady.
Now, farewell for the present. God bless you
both." Thus the blacksmith who beats his
money out of iron to spread the Gospel&mdash;writing,
talking, selling, all at once&mdash;the hammer
in his hand, God in his heart.</p>

<p>Miss Mary Whittington writes from Daughters'
College, and we should find interest in a
picture of the scene where Mattie Myers received
her education; "I have a faint idea of
how you feel, Mattie, off there in Australia,
for I took a four weeks' trip to Illinois, and
cried to get back to President Williams and
the college. You need a correspondent like
myself, to give you little suggestive trifles of
the college life. We have a baby here, wonderful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
blue-eyed and spiritual, not a girl, alas!
but a boy&mdash;Prince Whittington Williams&mdash;the
'Whittington' is for an old maid who, having
no children of her own, is thankful when people
sometimes name them for her&mdash;the writer,
in a word. Mattie, I hear the supper bell; I'll
run down and eat some battercakes, and drink
a cup of coffee&mdash;don't you wish you could hear
the supper-bell once more?</p>

<p>"Well, I had my supper in the same dining-room
where you drank tea, and dieted, of yore,
but it was not upon the same old oilcloth, for
now we have a table cloth! Moreover the room
is neatly carpeted, and the old chairs have been
carried into the school rooms to make way for
new ones. The girls' rooms have new carpets
<i>all over</i> them&mdash;no naked space under the bed&mdash;and
have been furnished with neat walnut
toilets, and full tin sets for the washstands;
and I must not forget the red oil-calico curtains."
(The reader must bear in mind that
during Mattie's sojourn here, such luxury was
unknown.)</p>

<p>"Mrs. Williams is fat and merry. President
Williams is also in a flourishing condition&mdash;weighs
160. His flesh makes him very handsome;
you ought to have seen him several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
months ago! The secret is that he has quit
tobacco. Dr. Williams is still himself. You
would have been convinced of it if you had
heard him this morning at church-time, when
he came storming into the library, crying out,
'Where's Mary? I don't intend waiting any
longer on anybody! Is she trying to keep me
waiting another half hour?' And there I had
been hiding behind the door half an hour,
waiting for him! It did me good to rise up,
and tell him so."</p>

<p>Here is a letter from our friend Albert Myles,
who carried Oliver away from his sick room in
Lexington to hold a meeting at Ghent: "When
you bade me goodby in Cincinnati about one
year ago,"&mdash;(how short it seems! and now, how
far away!)&mdash;"you remember that my health
was very bad. Well, it grew from bad to
worse, till I lay at death's door. At Crab
Orchard Springs I rallied, and grew steadily
better until October 20th, 1868, when I&mdash;I&mdash;what
shall I say?&mdash;I married! Yes, that was
the day that gave me my Ellen for my wife.
Two weeks later we took charge at the Mt.
Sterling church, where we are still doing what
we can in a small and humble way. * * * I
could see you two as you braved the dangers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the Irish Channel, and took the long voyage to
Australia. I could see you as you star-gazed
and moon-gazed; as you promenaded the deck;
as you sat and sang with the guitar; as you
read and prayed in the raging storm. As you
say, none but God can know what you suffered
on that voyage; but it is a precious thought
that He <i>does</i> know.</p>

<p>"Ol., I gather the following impression from
your answer regarding my coming out to Australia,
1. Melbourne is the best field in Australia.
2. This field is supplied. 3. Adelaide
is supplied by Gore, Earl and others. 4. New
Zealand is in danger of a war with the natives,
the issue of which is doubtful without help
from the government. 5. Whoever accepts the
80 must go to New Zealand. With these
facts before me, to be honest, it does not appear
to me that Australia is more in need of
preachers than many places in the United
States.</p>

<p>"In New York, there are only about 400
Disciples; in Philadelphia, only about 300;
while in Baltimore, Cincinnati, Chicago, St.
Louis and San Francisco, which will average
about 25,000 population, there is scarcely an
average of 100 Disciples; moreover, in many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
rural communities, we have not even been heard
of! In California are thousands of Chinese who
are actually worshiping-idols! It occurs to me,
that men who love the ancient order of things,
are as much needed here as in Australia. You
say also, that the manner of worship there is
different from what it is here. This being so,
one would have to spend some time preparing
himself for the changed condition. If I know
my own heart, I never wanted to do anything
so much in my whole life, as to go to Australia;
but the more I think of the matter, the more
firmly I am convinced that if one goes to Australia
at all, he ought to make up his mind to
stay there. J. C. Keith" (the other member
of our "Trio") "has succeeded in getting a
comfortable house of worship built in Louisville.
He is doing well." (We have a purpose
for presenting Mr. Myles' objections to going
to Australia, which will be developed later).</p>

<p>Another letter from brother Joe, written in
May, 1868, and of more than transient interest:
"The last spike on the Union Pacific Railroad
was driven last Monday. Thousands of faces
are turning Westward, where large farms can
be bought for small prices. New York and
San Francisco are at last united by a mammoth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
railroad that spans the continent. While
the last spike was being driven, telegraphic
wires were in connection with all the larger
cities, and at each stroke of the hammer, the
wires rang signal bells from the Atlantic to the
Pacific. As I read the accounts of the great
demonstrations, of processions and bonfires,
my own breast caught the spirit of the age of
great enterprises, and I felt like seeking my
fortune amid the rich prairies of the West.
But then, I thought, man's life does not consist
in the things he possesses; so I am resolved
to be content in my Old Kentucky Home! I
feel inexpressible satisfaction in the thought
that while teaching boys, I am exerting a purifying
and elevating influence,&mdash;an influence
that will mould society, and tinge its religious,
literary and charitable institutions, long after
this heart has ceased to beat. O, what a privilege
is ours, Mattie, of setting in motion waves
of eternal blessing! How strange that the great
mass of mankind neglect such opportunities!</p>

<p>"We are now agitating the question of the
removal of the Capitol from Washington. If
the Union remains undivided, such a step will
be made sooner or later. But wherever they
put the Capitol, <i>my</i> home shall be three miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
from Stanford on the Crab Orchard pike! I
like to think how I am going to fill one cellar
with choice apples to roast by the winter fires.
Wilt come and see us, and help peel and eat,
while we talk of Australia? And what rich
cider for you and brother Ollie! And there is
the garden&mdash;oh, what a variety of vegetables!
we'll store them away in the other cellar, and
keep them for you. And if you should happen
to come back home in strawberry time! Cake,
cream, berries&mdash;oh, you must not think of
staying longer than three years! Counting
six months for going and coming, and three
years for active service in Melbourne, you'll get
here in August, 1871. Well, we can visit the
Crab Orchard Springs together&mdash;they are only
distant a short buggy-ride of eleven miles on
the smooth pike&mdash;and we can take a jug along
and bring it back full. You say it will be too
warm? But remember, we have a good ice
house. Then what a fine lot of chickens and
eggs we will have and * * *" But by
this time sister Mattie is weary of cleaning off
her spectacles, and puts her head upon her arm
in that far-away Barclay Terrace, and gives it
up, gives it all up for the time&mdash;with faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Janie to ward off visitors. Oh, brother Joe,
how could you!"</p>

<p>Do you remember the English Murbys who
carried the Carrs away from their splendid
hotel in London, and established the missionaries
in their own house? Here is a note from
Mrs. Murby:</p>

<p>"I often take up my album to look at you
both. I think over again the events of the
few days we spent together so pleasantly. I
always regret your time with us was so short;
but we hope to give you a hearty welcome
again in old England." (Strange how everything
dear to us is "old!" It should be a comforting
thought to grandparents.)</p>

<p>"You overrate any little attentions we may
have given you. It was a great pleasure for us
to make your acquaintance. Our brother" (the
Chicago merchant) "returned to the land of
his adoption the month after you left. Willie
is a bonnie lad now, nearly eighteen months
old. Nellie is over four, and quite a little companion
for me." (Let us trust she, too, will
find primroses in the streets of London).</p>

<p>If you would like a photographic representation
of Kentucky University life, do not skip
this letter from J. H. Stover. It is nothing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
our purpose who the author may be; but he
has succeeded in laying before us not a description
of that college life, but the life itself.
Here is the scene in which Oliver, as a student,
so often mingled, and which Mattie, as a visitor,
so often looked upon; Lexington in the
month of June. Faded, almost gone, are
many of the words, but when we rescue them
from threatening oblivion, they throb again
with the <i>actual</i>, which throbs best in trivialities.</p>

<p>"Our exhibition went off last night. Brother
J. B. Jones gave his first oration before the
public; it was well delivered throughout. The
valedictory was by W. A. Oldham, who did
the best I ever heard him. Milligan, McGarvey,
Meng, Wilkes, etc., sat upon the rostrum.
The ladies had helped decorate the house with
cedar, etc., very tastefully. Robt. Milligan has
just got him a new coat and pair of boots. He
has laid aside that old coat which he used to
wear, even the first year. He has a new hat,
too, but he still keeps on the same old shawl.
He comes into chapel with his hand to his
head, as of old. He did not have his usual
sick spell this spring. The last time we met,
he told us that we were to have vacations from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
our duties, 'but, young brethren,' he said,
'there is no vacation in the school of Jesus
Christ, our adorable Redeemer.'</p>

<p>"Brother McGarvey is just the same&mdash;same
old coat. I went down to the dormitory this
morning and, as usual, there were about half
a dozen boys standing before Morton's bookstore.
They were discussing who had the
best speech, and showed the best delivery, at
the Exhibition, last night. Brother Jonathan
M. came out and said, 'Good morning, young
gentlemen!' in that tone bordering on sharpness,
as usual." (What a keen observer! We
should dread to wear our old coat where he
could see us!)</p>

<p>"Brother Myles is here. So is Miss Ella
Allen. They were together last night, but I
know nothing farther than when you left."
(The reader has already seen what <i>that</i> came
to.) "Professor Neville, W. T. Moore and
uncle Dick Bishop have gone to Europe. Professor
was excited to death. It was his long-looked
for trip. He bought him a new suit of
clothes, for the trip. He looked funny in his
sack coat. Professor White looks just the
same, except his hair is longer. Those same old
shoes with holes in the toes, he still wears. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
hat, turned down before, and up behind, hangs
on the peg on the post yet, during recitation-time.
The boys, as of old, went to the board,
'fizzed' and took their seats when he said, 'That
is sufficient, I believe!' When I went up to him
this morning to inquire my standing, he looked
into that <i>same book</i>. He told me I had finished
the Junior. As I went out the door, I slapped
my thigh. Don't a fellow feel good when he
studies hard, and does better than he looked
for! Alex. Milligan still walks as fast as ever,
and the bald place on the back of his head is
none the smaller. He is doing well in his book
store. Brother McGarvey told me this morning
to tell you he would write soon. I heard
from Jim Keith a few days ago. He is doing
well! Miss Whitie Hocker graduated at the
Sayer Institute last week. Our Sunday-school
had a festival about two months ago to which
the Midway Orphan School was invited. The
Bible school was dismissed. McGarvey and
Wilkes managed it. I think it was after you
left that John Morgan's remains were brought
here and interred. There was a very long procession.
As I was walking down the street,
today, I met J. B. Bowman in his old buggy,
behind that same old black, bobtailed mare.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
He was driving very fast as usual. Next I
met Prof. Pickett. Although it was a very
hot day, he had that coat buttoned up to his
chin. He had that same black cane, and he
saluted me in fine military style, then walked
on as fast as possible. I met the old darkey
who took care of G. L. Surber's room the first
year. He wanted to know if I had heard from
'Massa Green Surbah.' I saw old man White
with whom you used to board. He still has
the grocery on the corner; Kate isn't married
yet. He still swings his hands as he walks,
and ducks his head forward as usual. Brother
Lowber came up and said, 'Well, here is
Brother Stover; how <i>do</i> you come on, Brother
Stover?' I think he has asked me that same
question four times this morning, with the
same smile. He is a very warm and affectionate
friend.</p>

<p>"I saw Bob Neal next. He wore his hat as
you remember. Jerry Morton nodded his head
at me as he went by. Dick Stohl stopped me
to ask where he could find a Horace, and Cottingham
called to me from across the street.
As I came home, I met Brother Lard returning
from Winchester in his buggy; he had 25 additions
there. At the table, Brother V. P.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
told me his prayers were frequently in your behalf.
Dear brother Ollie, if I have succeeded in
interesting you with these trifles, I am repaid
for my long letters. Give Mattie my love, and
tell her I claim kin with her." (Which letter,
we fear, leaves Oliver about as homesick as J.
B. Myers' left Mattie.)</p>

<p>True to his promise, here comes a letter from
Prof. J. W. McGarvey: "We published your
letter, and a call for packages in the <i>Apostolic
Times</i>, and have received, in response, enough
books, pamphlets and newspapers to fill a
medium-sized goods box; we will ship them
soon. We now have a circulation of nearly
4,000 for the <i>Apostolic Times</i>. I received a
copy of your tract, and noticed it in the paper.
Innovationists have become rampant among
us; they expected to run over our Brother
Franklin by affecting superior knowledge, but
the <i>Times</i> cannot be frowned down in that
way. We hope to fill a gap in the ranks of the
faithful. You are right in not encouraging the
brethren to send to America for preachers
while neglecting useful men at home. Teach
them to encourage young men of promise.
Some changes have occurred in the University.
Brother Pickett resigned his presidency of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Agricultural College, and it was offered Brother
Errett. The chances are, however, that Errett
will take a chair of Bible study, just created at
Bethany. He will probably give up the <i>Standard</i>,
and it will die. It has never more than
paid expenses. Brother Graham has resigned
to take the presidency of the new female college
of which Brother Hocker is proprietor. John
Augustus Williams has been elected President
of the College of Arts. You both have a large
and warm place in the hearts of thousands of
the saints. The Lord be with you."</p>

<p>Another note from the Australian student,
now at the University: "I am now engaged
in the selling of books in the vacation: my object
is to make enough money to pay my way
through Bible College. My board cost me
nothing, for I am stopping at the home of Dr.
W. H. Hopson. I suppose by this time you
have received the books, magazines, etc., from
President Milligan. I preach occasionally at
Providence and Bethany. Cannot some of our
young brethren in Australia come out here and
prepare themselves to preach to poor dying
sinners? They may say they cannot pay the
passage; but if they love the Lord, they will
come, and work their way through."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>The following is from Mrs. Carr to her
brother: "How my heart blesses you, for almost
every mail brings us cheer from your pen!
If it be the will of God that we ever again see
each other face to face, you will know how
grateful I am. You would laugh if you could
see us running to the door at the ringing of
the postman, or leaping from our seats at the
cry of&mdash;'<i>Arrival of the British Mail!</i>' We
have many dear friends here, but a word from
Kentucky carries our hearts back in a mighty
rush, and all is lost in the old and tried affections
of home. Forget you, did you say? Ah,
we could not if we would. Come back to you,
did you say? Assuredly, if it is God's will.
When I come back, brother, I want to sit in
your lap, and with my arms about your neck,
tell you of my little trials, and of my many, very
many abiding joys. Ollie's health and mine, is
not good as when we first came here; we fear it
may be due to the climate. Ollie is so upright,
so gentle and kind to me, that I have strength
to bear everything.</p>

<p>"Now a question: Suppose we should establish
a College in Australia, exclusively for young
men, hoping some day to convert it into a university&mdash;and
suppose we should cry to America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
for professors&mdash;would you come? Think of
the cries of the churches here for education&mdash;how
they are obliged to send their young men
all the way to Kentucky to prepare them for
the ministry in the Christian Church. <i>Would</i>
you come?" And much more to the same
purpose, showing that this idea of a Christian
University in Australia, has become a fixed
idea with Mrs. Carr&mdash;an idea which she is not
to yield readily.</p>

<p>Now comes O. A. Carr to the charge, showing
a little of the heat of battle that has been
roused by controversy with the sectarians. It
is Thomas Magarey, father of Alex. and Vaney,
whom he accosts: "Thanks for candor, but
your admonition was unnecessary. I know
how it would aggravate a zealous brother to
think that my little squirt is throwing water
on the fire he is trying to keep aglow. You
seem to think that I am desperately bent on
doing nothing with a vengeance, especially if
it will injure Australia. It may be true I have
no more judgment than a pig; I may be showing
the pig&mdash;or dog, if you like,&mdash;in writing
this; but like you, if I am wrong, I apologize.
And now to the point: What I wrote was
solely to argue that we must not depend upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
America in the contemplated college affair.
My reason for believing that evangelists would
not come here from there, was the simple fact
of their not coming. I have never written a
line home derogatory to anyone's coming to
Australia. I wrote a confidential letter to
Brother Albert Myles, which he made me
promise to do; I gave my first impressions of
Australia, and they were more favorable than
I ever dreamed I could give, when I was at
home. As Brother Myles was to come on Adelaide
money, I frankly told him that I could
not give him any account of Adelaide. I never
believed Brother Myles would come, when we
received the call at the same time, for the conviction
that he should do so, was not so strong
as mine. His mother was a widow, and looked
to him for support. Brother Myles is as true
a soldier of the Cross as ever drew the sword.
Had he seen his way clearly, he would have
come, for he wanted to do so. I hold myself
free from throwing anything in the way.</p>

<p>"Pardon me for saying it, but I suppose I
will always be a '<i>new chum</i>' and 'too inexperienced
for old English women to sit under,' and
'who ought not to be allowed to write a little
Tract till some old, experienced brother had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
reviewed it to see if it were sound.' I want
you to believe that the 'new chum' wrote nothing
he could not prove, and that he is anxious
for all to come and help in the glorious work, who
ought to assume the responsible position of a
preacher. So much from the 'bear with the
sore head!' There; now! I haven't flared up.
I do hope you will send for more evangelists,
and that the country will be supplied with a
faithfully preached Gospel. Alex. is much
better, and is able to eat heartily; Vaney is
well. Mattie, I believe, is writing to you."</p>

<p>Back to the charge comes the doughty Englishman,
Member of Parliament, and miller
from South Australia: "It is a very busy day
with me, but I must not leave you under painful
feelings caused by hasty words of mine.
As I was mistaken, I am heartily thankful,
and apologize without reserve. In the first
place, you <i>are</i> a new chum, and nine out of
ten new chums write home under disappointed
feelings, as the romance melts from those visions
which lend enchantment to the view.
But since you did not do so, I am much to
blame for hasty accusation. As to the rest,
you misunderstood my letter. The fault is
with me. I am always getting myself into unpleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
scrapes by my correspondence. Even
the newspapers that report my speeches complain
that they cannot tell whether I am joking,
or in earnest. I have always looked upon
you as a great acquisition to the cause of Christ
in Australia. I cannot imagine what you
mean by talking of 'a bear with a sore head.'
I am utterly unconscious of having written
anything to give rise to your expression. Will
you kindly send me the whole passage. I do
not think of you as a bear at all, sore-headed
or otherwise. Why, I look upon you as one
of the pillars of the Cause. I think,&mdash;if we
get so much out of Brother Carr at 24, what
will we get at 30! Then I think that by the
time you are 30, you will have ruined your
health, and be fit for nothing. I feel angry
that you undertake so much. I know, had it
not been for you during Brother Surber's absence
in New Zealand, the Cause would have
gone to ruin in Melbourne. Then how could
I have thought you in the way, as 'a pig,' or
as a man? I do not think any of our evangelists
are without faults; but if I let them see
that I do not consider them faultless, they should
not therefore run back to America, as they sometimes
threaten to do! I ought to have known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
better than to take such freedom with our
friends from Kentucky. It is said by travelers
that a Southerner will allow you to tell him his
faults, or his country's faults. But he will
not; or can not, understand any playful allusions
to them. Now, Brother Carr, I am exceedingly
sorry to have written anything that
hurt your feelings. I begin to have some dim
recollection that I <i>may</i> have written something
about a bear with a sore head, but I cannot
remember what it was. What <i>was</i> it? I have
Sister Carr's letter; am delighted with it;
was afraid she might be cross about that bear.
I have no letter from my boys, but hope to receive
one soon. But I must close this long rigamarole
which I cannot read myself, it is so
badly done."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>As a last letter in this chapter's mail&mdash;what
a long chapter it is making!&mdash;this is offered
from Martin Zelius, he who began Melbourne
life with one shilling, and later sent to America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the gold that brought over Mr. and Mrs. Carr;
it will show that he, too, was interested in that
Tract: "I have heard that you intend to investigate,
and bring out, the injustice that one
of the religious bodies here has done our people.
I hope you will do it most effectually, not for
the sake of victory, nor of retaliation, but for
the love of the truth. Stand up at any time,
and under any circumstances, to defend the
commands of Jesus. He has said he will never
leave us, nor forsake us. When we have our
friend Jesus to stand by us, our confidence is
raised to the highest pitch. My dear brother,
it brings the tears to my eyes when I look back
on the past, and see how Jesus has shielded me
from many a trial, from many a foe. Stand up
for him, Brother Carr! He who is with us is
more than all who can be against us!"</p>

<p>The way in which the Church of Christ looked
at religious matters was so different from
the usual view, that the American evangelists
felt the pressing need of tracts to disseminate
their ideas. One illustration of their effectiveness,
may close this branch of the subject.</p>

<p>There was a young man whose parents lived
in a house passed, every day, by the Carrs, on
their way to town. The father belonged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
one denomination, the mother to another, while
the son, finding the Calvinistic doctrines of
both repellant to his bent of mind, refused to
accept any scriptural or unscriptural principles.
He graduated at the Melbourne University,
then took a special course for the degree of M.
D. He went into the adjacent country to practice,
without having ever met the missionaries.
One day he came across one of O. A. Carr's
tracts. "I read it with great interest," he
said. "I asked myself, is this the truth? I
was then unsatisfied with the truths of Christianity."</p>

<p>The young man sought his Bible, and began
with Moses and the prophets, in a course of
systematic and scrupulous examination of the
Word. He read himself into the belief of the
Christian church. He called upon the neighbors
to meet in a hall, that he might tell them
what had won him to Christianity. He delivered
to them a course of lectures, insisting that
everything needful to man's salvation, and life
of holiness, was explicitly laid down in the
Bible. At the conclusion he cried out, "Is
there any one here who believes?"</p>

<p>More than a hundred rose and answered yes!
He heard them confess their faith in Christ's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
divinity. He baptized them. Having determined
to prepare himself for the ministry, he
laid aside his practice, went to Kentucky University,
and, thanks to his splendid education,
was able to finish the course in a year. Thus
Dr. A. M. Fisher became Fisher the Evangelist,
thanks to a tract written by one who, not
many years before, was gathering up the shavings
in Myall's wagon shop.</p>

<h3>BUSY YEARS IN AUSTRALIA.</h3>


<p>In the shifting crowds of men and
women along our life-pilgrimage,
few are those who feel an abiding interest
in the concerns of others. We
meet and part, each thinking of what
he may have gained in the way of social inspiration,
rather than of what he may have imparted.
It is not indifference, however, which most
severely galls the sensitive spirit; it is the active
opposition that ever seems the lot of him or her
who would help humanity. I do not know if
any feet have reached the upper rounds of high
ideals, without shaking off detaining hands.
In the case of Mrs. Carr, influences adverse
not only to her work, but to her peace of mind,
were destined to attend her through life.</p>

<p>It is impossible to estimate the good that
might be accomplished, if mankind would rally
around those souls fired with lofty purposes,
and strengthen and make more effective those
purposes, by sympathetic encouragement; if it
were human nature to add to lofty ambitions,
by lending substance from one's own slighter
forces. But it appears to be the rule that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
wherever one is found who desires to do a great
good for others, a dozen are found to weaken
his influence and to seek to undermine his work.
Those physical mannerisms which are presently
to perish with the flesh, are seized upon for the
purpose of striking dead, influences which
might otherwise have been eternal.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Carr, experienced for the first
time the cruelty of this truth, she was unprepared
for it. In later years, having learned
her lesson, having been convinced that opposition
to truth is inherent to human nature, she
was able to hold her courage with a fixed and
steel-willed conviction, that cut its way through
all walks of opposition. But at first she was
not prepared for this unlovely trait of lesser
minds. Accordingly, we sometimes find her
sinking, wavering, fluttering like a bird in a
snare, before the breath of treachery, and the
opposition of jealous natures.</p>

<p>To understand the story of this life in its
entirety, one must know the details of these
struggles and these disappointments. Yet we
would rather leave the story incomplete, than
perpetuate misunderstandings and misrepresentations.
Those who opposed Mrs. Carr in
all of her educational plans, share the fate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
of one who chooses as his part in life, that of
opposition. It is not he who opposes, but he
who performs, to whom the world owes its
gratitude. Those who are antagonistic to
good works, court the oblivion that awaits
them. Those who, in spite of discouragements
and hostility, hold tenaciously to lofty purposes,
leave to the world such monuments of
their devotion, as the sun-kissed college on the
flower-embossed hill overlooking Sherman,
Texas.</p>

<p>We shall content ourselves, therefore, with
passing by, in silence, the words and deeds of
the ill-natured, the unfriendly and the indifferent.
One should not go back into the past
to gather its thorns. So much is said at this
place, that those conversant with the controversies
and contentions of school and church
life during the last quarter of the nineteenth
century, need not expect to find them reanimated
in this volume.</p>

<p>The following selection from Mrs. Carr's
diary deals with her first trip to North Tasmania
whither, two years later, she and her
husband were to go for a year's sojourn:</p>

<p>"Jan. 3. Left for Hobart Town, Tasmania,
on the ship <i>Southern Cross</i>. Sisters at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
wharf. Kissed Ollie goodby. Dashed away
the tears&mdash;may we meet again, dear husband!</p>

<p>"4th. Passed through Port Philip's Bay.
Over the Rip, that terrible Rip! what seasickness
it brings! Terrible storm! I was crowded
out of my birth, but was glad to get the fresh
air. The captain and stewardess were kind.
The Lord bless them.</p>

<p>"5th. Reached Hobart Town, 7 a. m. Met
by the Walworths, to whom Ollie had telegraphed.
Saw more vice in two hours than I
saw in New York in two weeks. What wicked
people!</p>

<p>"6th. Sailed in the <i>Monarch</i> to New Norfolk,
22 miles. Scenery along the Derwent is
grand, but not to be compared to that of the
beautiful Ohio. Hop gardens far up the hills,
shrouded in mists. How lovely!</p>

<p>"7th. Visited Salmon Ponds, 7 miles from
New Norfolk. Salmons raised here, as they
are not native to Australia; 30,000 sent to the
ocean yearly through the streams that supply
the ponds from the Derwent. Returned to
North Tasmania by coach; fine view of the
country&mdash;how I wished for Ollie!</p>

<p>"8th. Stormy day. Spent it indoors, sewing
and gazing at frowning Mt. Wellington,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the pride of Tasmania. Attended services on
a man-of-war.</p>

<p>"10th. Visited Town Hall and Museum.
Saw handwriting of the King of Madagascar.</p>

<p>"11th. Went by coach to Launceston, distance
of 120 miles. The grand mountainous
scenery compensated for the long ride. Passed
the Western ridge on top of which smile beautiful
lakes, 1,000 feet above the sea. More like
Kentucky than any scenery I've witnessed.</p>

<p>"12th. Visited Cataract Gorge on South
Esk. To Prince's Square where stands the
finest fountain in the Colonies; it was imported
from Paris.</p>

<p>"13th. At Mechanics' Institute saw life-size
oil paintings of Victoria and Prince Albert,
and the Prince and Princess of Wales. What
a sweet, gentle face Princess Alexandria has!
Dear woman, she deserves a better husband.
These people are so kind to me&mdash;Ollie will love
them for that.</p>

<p>"14. Visited Mr. Gunn, Curator of Museum,
who promised to send specimens to Kentucky
University. My husband's Alma Mater is dear
to me, because dear to him. Launceston by
Tamar. Sick all the way to Port Philip.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Scenery along Tamar not so bold as along the
Derwent.</p>

<p>"15th. Reached Melbourne, and waited at
Brother Zelius' to see Ollie. How glad I am to
be with my dear husband once more. May the
dear Lord spare him till I die. Only God
knows how dear he is to me; God will not take
him from me."</p>

<p>At this time, the youth whom we have
known as "Vaney" Magarey, leaves the Carrs'
household, no longer to play marbles in the
third story at stolen intervals, but to take his
place in the world as Dr. S. J. Magarey; the
"Vaney" quite lost among these dignified initials.
Also his brother "Alex." departs, meaning
to sail to America. From Adelaide, Vaney
writes back; sending Mrs. Carr ten pounds,
evidently on her birthday, for he tells Mr. Carr,
"I promised Mrs. Carr ten pounds. Please
lay them on with your fist with as much severity
as you think fitting." Then he tells of
8,000 worth of Adelaide gold just discovered,
and sends his regards to all inquiring friends,
"except tailors and bailiffs."</p>

<p>Somewhat later, he writes that he will not
return; another may have his room. He is interested
in Mr. Carr's work as a teacher of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
prospective ministers,&mdash;"For goodness' sake,
do not turn them out half-educated. Sometimes
students are allowed to leave the Academy
before they know enough, and then they
cause anxiety to many, and prejudice people
against colonial-made preachers." As for
Vaney, himself, "We are at the seaside, and
have a swim every morning, and drive every
day."</p>

<p>An interesting character, this gay young
physician, son of the rich M. P. As we have
seen, he and his brother were accustomed to
address the congregations on Sunday mornings,
while they attended the University of
Melbourne. When he had graduated, Vaney
or "S. J." as we must call him now, went to
South Australia and lived with his father,
where Gore was editing the <i>Pioneer</i>. The
young physician married one of Mrs. Carr's
favorite pupils. He became successful in his
profession, while his brother developed into a
splendid preacher. "Alex. preaches and I practice,"
said the doctor. When it was necessary
for Mr. Gore to be absent from the pulpit, he
would call on "Dr. S. J." to preach the sermon
in his stead.</p>

<p>In the meantime the father, Thomas Magarey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
has seen his son "Alex." off to America,
in the company of Evangelist Earl. He writes
to Mr. Carr, but not now about bears with
sore heads: "I have your letter dated 'Washington's
birthday.' I have heard something
of Washington, but never heard that he had a
birthday. I suppose Washington is one of
those best kind of demons, more worshipped in
America than England. When I go to Barnum's
Museum, I will inquire for his birthday.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear your Forrester's Hall was
so hot, because I had thought our White's
Room the hottest place in Australia. I am still
inclined to think we can sweat freer at White's.
I am glad Brother H. makes a good deacon; I
am always glad when a Scotchman can be
found good for something. Dr. Johnson says
the animal ought to be caught while young.
You say your health is better, but I cannot believe
it, for you give yourself no chance to get
better. Go away and take a rest. Why was
Paul allowed to waste so much time and energy?
Was he not a citizen of no mean city
(the Kentucky of his day?) Was he not senior
wrangler under Prof. Gamaliel? Had he not
graduated with honors and degree of A. M.
from the University of Jerusalem? He was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
least master of the art of tent-making. Yet with
all these accomplishments, he went away somewhere
into Arabia for three years. Then he
goes from city to city afoot, in danger of being
robbed&mdash;why wasn't he provided with a buggy?
Instead of preaching in a jail, why not have
occupied the biggest house in Phillippi? It
wouldn't have been refused after that earthquake.
Instead of working at his trade for
bread, wouldn't it have been better for the missionary
cause, if the brethren had paid him a
salary, and had him give all his time to preaching?
What a waste of time! He might have
been writing a "Reply&mdash;<i>a Tract</i>"&mdash;to the Rev.
Annanias of the Temple. And think of him
at Rome, chained to a Roman soldier (no doubt
a Yankee barbarian!) Why, if he had been
chained to a Barnabas or Titus, they must
soon have got to quarreling. Think of him
two years in his own hired house, when the
church of Rome ought to have put out handbills
that Rev. Paul would preach at the Town
Council! But perhaps there were Scotch
deacons in that church, for we know there
were Britains in Rome. They were too cautious.</p>

<p>"But a thought upsets my theory. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the Lord saw that Paul's own mind needed the
discipline through which he was passing. Perhaps
it is so with young men of the present
day&mdash;sometimes their energy seems wasted;
but it may be in order to make the most of
their good qualities; that they may learn in
time to be sorrowful, yet always rejoicing.
Well, I must close my letter and go out into
the barren wilderness which surrounds me, in
which the shepherd is at wits' end to find pasture
for the sheep."</p>

<p>From Mrs. Carr's diary, Mar. 27, 1870:
"Two years ago we made those holy vows to
each other that only God can sever. Two
years ago, we left brothers and sisters, and all
the tender associations of sweet home. May
we ever be true to each other, and to God. O
blessed Savior, give me more of thy gentleness
and of thy humility. Make me a better child
and a better wife, as the silent years creep on,
leading me closer to the grave,&mdash;the dark path
that leads to the beautiful mansion in our
Father's house. * * * Visited Botanical
Gardens, overlooking the Bay. Visited Barrabool
hills and along Barwon river to Geelong
across the Bay, 50 miles from Melbourne,
where we got a cup of milk."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>On Mrs. Carr's birthday, her pupils thus
testify to their affection: "We cannot permit
this opportunity to pass without manifesting
our appreciation of the excellent course of instruction
you have pursued, and the kindness,
perseverance and patience you have combined
with Christian love and forbearance, with
which you have exercised your arduous duties.
You have not only enlarged our understanding,
but excited in our hearts a deep feeling of love.
You are more like a dear, fond friend than a
teacher. The most difficult lessons become,
under your guidance, pleasant studies. May
you live many years to pursue the noble efforts
of your life."&mdash;Signed by the young ladies of
her class.</p>

<p>From J. B. Bowman, now in Washington
City: "I have been prosecuting a claim for
damages done the University buildings during
the war; I will succeed in getting $25,000,
which will be expended in the erection of buildings
at Ashland. I have written thanking you
for your valued favor of shipping the box of
specimens for the Museum. We had the pleasure
of opening it to-day at the Smithsonian
Institution, and oh! how delighted was I, with
the rare and beautiful things in it! It shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
placed in a special case in Ashland. Sister
Mattie, how exact they are in the classification
and arrangement, showing so much care and
skill and science on your part! General Latham
arrived after a trip of six months. He called on
me to-day at the department. He says Sister
Carr is the most highly educated and accomplished
lady in Australia. We have about 800
enrolled at the University. The Bible College is
a grand success. I propose nominating Jas.
C. Keith as Adjunct Professor. Oh, if I had
a million dollars, there would be 500 in the Bible
College! To this end of enlarging the University,
I am working and praying every day of
my life."</p>

<p>Mr. Carr to Mrs. Carr&mdash;relative to this brief
visit to Sidney: "September 27, '71: We will
reach Sidney at dark to-night. It is hard to
write on the ship. All of us have been very
sick, but it is fine now. The wind is fair and
we are gliding along most beautifully as we
promenade the deck. There is a man on board
who has been in Louisville, and <i>May's Lick</i>!
His name is Smith; a brother of John's I presume!</p>

<p>"28th: After a fine dinner yesterday at five,
we had music on deck. Dark came on, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
with it the lights of Sidney Harbor. It was
the grandest view I ever had of any harbor.
The lights were everywhere, and their reflection
in the water was like posts surmounted by
candles, and we were sailing right into the
midst of these posts. We came right up to
the wharf and there stood a number of Sidney
friends to put us in cabs. After I went to bed,
the old steamer was still roaring in my ears,
and the floor was moving up and down, as I
went off to dreamland. I am now sitting in a
little parlor with a headache, waiting for breakfast
and fearfully hungry.</p>

<p>"30th: I saw Parliament houses, and fine
they are. I walked through Hyde Park,
where is a monument to Captain Cook with
this inscription; 'Captain Cook, born in
Yorkshire 1726, founded this territory 1770.'
Just over the monument I saw, away in the
distance, part of Sidney harbor, the sun shining
on the hills, and glistening in the water.
Visited a former servant of the Magareys, who
is now independent and owns a mill of his own.
His daughter is a fascinating little creature&mdash;don't
be jealous!&mdash;a perfect prodigy on the
piano. They insist that I must preach here
two Sundays.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sidney is the funniest laid-out place I ever
saw. Part of the city is compact, the streets
running every direction, at all angles, like London,
while a short distance toward New Town
there is a cowpen or paddock. The houses
are strongly and handsomely built of massive
stone, and some have stone steps running to
the top of the three stories. Some houses
look as if they had stood for centuries. It
seems to me that the poorest thing the people
have is religion. The one thing needful is the
only thing neglected. I am not over my seasickness,
and even now the table seems to be
going up and down as I write. Give my love
to Surber and Zelius, etc. If my tooth quits
aching, I shall bring it back to Melbourne in
my mouth.</p>

<p>"Oct. 3rd: Preached yesterday to small but
interesting audiences. At night, three confessions&mdash;the
first ever had in Sidney immediately
after the preaching. The brethren were
delighted.</p>

<p>"Oct. 4th: Went to hear an elocutionary
effort in a little chapel; I was charmed by the
speaker's manner and style, but pained because
he did not preach the Gospel. From
there we hurried on a boat for a trip up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Parramatta river, and saw Sidney Harbor to
best advantage. I never saw such a sight, not
even in old Kentucky! It is beautiful beyond
description. The river was clear and smooth,
sparkling in the sun. As far as the eye could
reach were the weeping willows and pines, and
trees whose foliage had the appearance of a
continuous mountain range, relieved by beautiful
flowers and lawns surrounding the prettiest
houses, in front of which were the winding
walks. The red soil and bright pebbles
glistened down to the shore-bridge, where the
boat would stop for passengers. We saw
many islands where were beautiful houses and
gardens, and could see the people walking
about in their island homes. The most famous
was Cockatoo Island whither the convicts were
once sent, from which there was no possible
escape. There stood the houses in which they
had once lived. As the steamer glided on,
we saw the ripe oranges hanging from the
trees, and when we landed to go to a hotel at
Parramatta, the perfume of the flowers followed
us through the streets.</p>

<p>"Oct. 9th: Your two letters came, and I
had a rare treat reading them. I was so glad
to hear of the success you are having in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
matter of raising funds to build the chapel!
Hurrah for those sisters at Collingwood!
We'll have a chapel, won't we? Certainly, if
my wife takes the enterprise in hand!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr to Mr. Carr, while he was on his
visit to Sidney: "It is very stormy today on
land,&mdash;what will it be on the sea? I dreamt
last night of a sinking ship. In reaching forward
to save you, I awoke. May God bring
you back safe to me, my dear, dear husband!
Jane Nash" (of whom the reader is presently
to hear) "is going to Tasmania in about a
fortnight to be married to Brother Smith; she
wants you to perform the ceremony. Can you
not come home by way of Tasmania? Jane
will go over any time you can be there. Let
us know."</p>

<p>Among the young men who were bound to
the Carrs by tender affection, and a common
religious interest, was George Smith, a hatter
by trade. Some time before the Sidney experience,
Mr. Carr met Smith on the street,
and the young man grasped the minister's
hand, while the tears shone in his eyes. He
had been out of a job for some time. "And
now," he said, "I have found a position. I
answered an advertisement a few days ago, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
a telegram has come for me to take a place at
once."</p>

<p>"Then what is the trouble?" asked Mr.
Carr.</p>

<p>The trouble was that the position offered
Smith was at Hobart Town, in Tasmania.
There was no Church of Christ at Hobart
Town; there was no one known to the young
hatter, and, moreover, there was Jane! "How
can I leave the brethren?" exclaimed Smith;
"and how can I leave Jane?"</p>

<p>Jane Nash had been reared a Roman Catholic.
Through the influence of her suitor, she
was induced to attend the preaching. She was
so disturbed by what she heard, that she resolved
to take her Bible, visit the different
preachers, and have them point out the places
that might tell her what to do to be saved.
She visited several; but they could only tell her
to read her Bible, to pray, to wait for a divine
influence. At last, she accosted Mr. Surber
with her oft repeated question: "Will you tell
me what I must do to be saved?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you," said Mr. Surber; "but
I will direct you to those who can; men who
ought to know, for the Savior himself inspired
them to speak his will."</p>

<p>Jane was greatly excited. Mr. Surber took
her back to the day of Pentecost, and had her
sit under the preaching of Peter. Her question
was the very one Peter had been asked.
The answer on that day was the answer now.
Jane confessed her faith, and was baptized.</p>

<p>It was best for George Smith to leave Melbourne,
that he might make a home for himself
and his betrothed. Dear as both were to
the Carrs, they urged the young man to accept
the position, and Jane, to wait till he could
send for her. After they were married, they
faded for a time from the lives of Mr. and Mrs.
Carr; but, as we shall presently see, they were
again to enter their history in a way more
pronounced.</p>

<p>In the meantime J. C. Keith writes from
Louisville, and gives us a melancholy bit of news
as regards that Australian student whom we
had seen dropping potatoes, to hurry along his
education; Keith writes to Mrs. Carr: "I have
read with interest all your articles to our different
papers. You are doing a noble work for
the Master. Few women in this fashion and
money-loving age would endure so much for
the Savior. Oh, that woman would rise to the
dignity of her position! * * * My letter has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
been interrupted. The life of a city preacher
is a checkered, yet a glorious one. One day he
exhorts the brethren to be faithful, the next he
faces a bridal pair, the next he stands beside
the dead; then he visits the poor and bereaved
and goes reading, and singing, and praying,
on his way. I met Brother Earl and Magarey"
(our Alex.) "Earl is working hard to raise
the $20,000 for your Bible College in Australia.
I saw Mr. Cowley yesterday. He is in this
city, working for some Boston book house."
(This is our enthusiastic Australian pupil.
Note his sequel.) "Don't think the Cause lost
much." (Ah, yes, let us solace ourselves as
best we may.)</p>

<p>J. W. McGarvey writes encouraging words,
not about young Cowley, who, alas! is no longer
ours, but regarding another Australian student
who is destined to remain in the fold: "Our
Bible College is moving on with steady growth.
We have 107 matriculates and expect 20 more.
The <i>Apostolic Times</i> is growing in favor, but
not so rapidly as we would like. The tendency
among us is strongly in favor of latitudinarianism;
our opposition to this rouses counter opposition.
<i>The Standard</i>, under its free and
easy policy, has almost caught up with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
<i>Review</i>. <i>The Christian</i> has at last possession
of the <i>Pioneer</i>, and has a clear field in
Missouri. We have recently had a runaway
match of a rather unusual character. A young
son of Brother G. W. Longan of Missouri,
who was a student at the Bible College, got a
dismissal to go home, and slipped off with Emma
Lard, Brother Lard's third daughter.
Bad for the children of two preachers! All the
special friends of the parties are very much
mortified. The young couple are poor and inexperienced;
they have a poor prospect before
them. "Brother Capp" (our young man from
Australia) "is making a good student. He is
industrious, popular, and recites very well for
a new pupil. Much love to Sister Carr, and
many thanks for her good letters in the
<i>Times</i>."</p>

<p>John Augustus Williams is very doubtful
about that Australian University scheme; he
writes to Mrs. Carr: "I know the Lord, by
his tender providence, is guiding you to do a
good and noble work. I hardly know what to
say in reference to your proposed trip to the
United States with a view to raise funds for a
College in Australia. No doubt you could succeed
better than Brother Earl" (whose efforts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
for $20,000 came to nothing). "But you
would assume a great undertaking. While I
would give you all the help I could, you would
have to depend mainly on your own personal
appeals. It is impossible to excite any general
interest in an enterprise that lies so far away.
Though Charity may extend a liberal hand,
she does not reach far."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr, in a letter, gives a sidelight on
her busy life: "If you could follow me one day
through No. 4 Barclay Terrace, and then
through the streets of Melbourne, you would
lay your finger upon my lips, should I seek to
apologize for not writing oftener. I am discharging
some duty every waking hour, and I
rarely retire till after twelve. Yet with all my
humble efforts, a host of duties unfulfilled is
daily pressing upon my conscience. Often in the
storm, it is a perplexity to know what should
be done first. But I rejoice that I had the
strength to cut the cord binding me to the
vanities of life. No, I do not complain, for I
never <i>lived</i> until I came to Australia. When
I read, two years ago, Mrs. Browning's line,
'Where we live, we suffer and toil,' I thought
it a golden bar of poetry; now I know it to be
a diamond of truth. Then, it moved my girl's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
spirit with the murmur of the outer world;
now, it pushes my woman's nature toward the
inner significance of all things. Yes, to suffer
and toil, is to live!</p>

<p>"So I enjoy this life; but I should enjoy it
intensely, if I had but three hours every day to
devote to self-improvement. It may be a selfish
desire; not having a single hour to cultivate
my mind, is a sore trial. I try to smother this
longing, fearing it may be wrong; but my
every effort seems to give it a brighter glow.
It is a part of my life, a part of the life that
hungers after the beautiful, the wise, the infinite.
If I were with you, I would bore you
from morning to night with poetry; for during
my summer vacations in girlhood, my store of
poetry grew painfully immense. Have you read
'Gold Foil,' and 'Bitter Sweet,' or 'Dream
Life,' and 'Reveries of a Bachelor'? If not, a
rich feast awaits you. There is a deep, strong
poetry in all that dropped from 'Ike Marvel's
pen, though he wrote nothing but prose. I
thought of comparing that brilliant writer to
Washington Irving, but remembered the grave
of buried love, and Friendship weeping there,
and my hand refused to commit the sacrilege."</p>
<p>In October, 1871, we find that one of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
"Trio"&mdash;the graduating class of '67&mdash;has been
attacked by a foe from whom there is to be no
escape. The letter is from Albert Myles:
"Yes, the notice in the <i>Times</i> by Brother
Brooks was correct. I am disabled from
preaching&mdash;my last sermon was delivered April
26th, six months ago. I may never be well
enough to preach again, though I try to keep
a brave heart and hope on. It was at first a
cold, of which I thought little, but instead of
getting better, I finally had a cough&mdash;the doctors
said it was bronchitis. By their advice,
I resigned my position and went to St. Louis,
as the doctors said a rest would restore me.
But shortly after I came to the city, the 8th
and Mound Street congregation earnestly solicited
my services. They are poor, and only
about 200. I consented to preach twice on
Lord's day, if they would not ask me to visit;
but it was a mistake; the work did not seem
heavy, but I grew worse, and worse. I still
thought my lungs were sound, and being called
to the church at Columbia, Mo., I thought I
would go there for the country air. I had been
but a week or two, when I was compelled to
quit and return to St. Louis. I had the doctors
examine me again, and, to my utter astonishment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
they said with great unanimity that I
had old fashioned tubercular consumption, and
that my life depended upon quitting preaching
immediately, and that, for a good while. I
have not dared even to exhort in prayer meeting,
since then. As to my coming to Australia,
the dangers of the voyage have never been
considered by me. But if I come&mdash;for I cannot
even yet decide <i>not</i> to do so&mdash;could the trip improve
me sufficiently to labor there? And suppose
I came, and could do no more than I do
here!</p>

<p>"My headquarters are still in St. Louis; but
I am not living anywhere in particular. I am
at Mt. Sterling, Ky., now, where I see your
brothers nearly every day. They do not look
strong, but you can't tell anything about the
Carr tribe by their looks, they are such a bony
set! I must go to church now&mdash;will finish this
letter after church if strong enough." The
next day he takes up the pen again. "You
have doubtless seen an account of the death of
my brother James. No man in the ministry
did so much work as he, in the same length of
time. He was literally the victim of overwork!
We have also lost our darling little Allene; she
was 20 months old. Not only we, but every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
one thought her remarkably beautiful. Dear
Ol., you have never been blessed with one of
these little heavenly messengers; but neither
have your hopes, once kindled, been turned to
ashes. May the Heavenly Father give us the
strength to endure."</p>

<p>So cries out our young Christian soldier, almost
fallen in the last trench of the hard battle;
a cry for help, but a cry, too, of fealty, to
his great Captain. One by one his arms have
been stripped from his feeble grasp&mdash;he cannot
even exhort in prayer meeting!&mdash;and how fondly
he remembers the date of his last sermon!&mdash;and
no little Allene ("I shall never love another
child so well," he says)&mdash;no fighting brother
James to carry on the standard. But he still
hopes he may get to Australia for missionary
service. We, who cannot share his hopes, can at
least rejoice that he began duty so young; for
consider this; in the few years of his ministry,
he has done more for Christ, than many a man
of sixty.</p>

<p>His beloved schoolmate, Oliver Carr, stands
much in the danger of James Myles. His energies
are all gone&mdash;we do not say wasted, but
spent; a vacation is imperative, and the missionary
turns toward South Australia, whence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
have come the letters from Magarey and Gore,
and Gore's father-in-law, Philip Santo. Mr.
Carr goes thither on a visit to these three&mdash;the
rich miller, the evangelist and editor, and the
rich iron monger. This holiday furnishes us
with the concluding series of the present chapter.
The time is the Australian spring (or
American Fall) of 1871.</p>

<p>Mr. Carr to Mrs. Carr: "I am in Brother
Gore's study at Clapham, safe and sick. I
was met by Santo," (M. P.) "Earl" (who failed
in his attempt to bring over American gold
for our Australian College) "Moysey" (who sold
his calf some time ago to buy school books,
not in vain) "Gore" (who has a new baby, T.
J., Jr., by name, and affords the Australianized
Kentuckian a fresh vantage point from which
to argue against homesickness) "and many
others. I never was so thoroughly seasick. I
was on the bed or couch from one harbor to
the other. I'm sick yet. Brother Gore and I
came near talking all last night through. I've
been asked many questions about Miss Ettie"
(Gore's sister-in-law, who wrote to her father,
"I love you," and who is still attending Mrs.
Carr's boarding-school.)</p>

<p>He writes the next day: "I've gotten off my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
sea-legs, but my health is no better. We drove
out to Magarey's and the family were glad to
see us" (no talk of sore-headed bears, we may
conclude). "Alex. is well," (who preaches
while his brother "practices.") "For the first
time, I pulled ripe oranges from the tree. We
talked incessantly. I ate six before dinner."
(The talk, then, not quite incessant!) "This
country about Adelaide is a level plain for 200
miles around the seashore, girt by hills like
those at Maysville on the Kentucky side. In
the early morning, as I look at those hills and
the lovely plains silvered with light, all is so
much like home that my heart rises in my
mouth, and I could almost say poetry! Adelaide
seems to have been laid out for about
200,000 people, but only about 30,000 have
come; so the spaces between the houses have
been made into lawns and fragrant gardens.
It is truly a rural place. The houses are principally
one-story, with gardens, trees, etc. I
only wish you were here to enjoy it. We talked
about Kentucky University and the 'boys,'
etc., all day long. These are just my kind of
folk!"</p>

<p>Mr. Carr a few days later: "I am resting,
oh, so good! I'm as easy as an old shoe&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
wrote that while looking at Brother Santo,
who had just come in to sauce me. He is a
good man; I have a deal of fun with him. I
get on the scales nearly every day to see if I've
fattened. I wish you could breathe this clear,
fresh air, and the perfume of the roses! I can
hardly stop in the house long enough to write
a letter. I baptized one last night. I told you
how scattered the houses of Adelaide are&mdash;no
danger of anybody's getting killed by being
run over. This air is so clear that you can
distinctly see the bodies of the trees and the
cows grazing on the hills, six miles away. Tell
Miss Ettie I don't blame her for being homesick
for a place like this; all the family are just
like Miss Ettie, so you would like them all."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr to Mr. Carr: "I am distressed
over Dr. Campbell's diagnosis. If your right
lung is weak, a few more weeks' preaching in
the hall would bring on disease. Now, my
dear husband, the best thing that you could
do, is to act the part of a rational being by
taking the doctor's advice. If you will spend
the summer in Tasmania" (whither our friend
Geo. Smith has gone to make tall silk hats,)
"I will gladly stay here in Melbourne for your
sake. If you ought to return to America before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the building of the Chapel&mdash;in other words,
before the Cause is firmly established in Collingwood,&mdash;I
am willing to do that or anything
to re-establish your health. These are only
suggestions; your own judgment must decide.
No consideration could induce me to oppose
you in any course the doctor might pronounce.
Ollie, take good care of yourself. I am glad
you and Brother Gore are going to the mountains.
Climb Mt. Lofty, if it is accessible.
You won't be able to tease Ettie about her
country, when you return, you are so enthusiastic
about its beauties. My birthday party
passed off happily. My girls surprised me with
a beautiful toast rack, butter knife and candlestick.
It was a real surprise. We had delightful
music. Two complimentary tickets just
came for you from the Town Hall. Ettie and
I will have the tickets, and you can have the
honor. May the Lord bless you, my darling,
and give you the strength to accomplish your
proposed work in this land. I will be as
economical as I can, that your health may not
suffer for want of travel. Your large donation
to the Chapel Fund will make things a little
hard, but the Lord will supply us in a way
that we know not."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Carr to Mrs. Carr: "I have been with
Alex. to see such sights from the top of
Mt. Lofty, as I cannot describe. The Magareys
have done their best to make me happy,
and oh, I do enjoy it! We went to church;
Brother &mdash;&mdash; gave us the fall of Jericho.
We got home at 9, enjoyed our cocoa, then to
rest. Brother Gore is going to give his class a
two weeks' holiday; then we will go fishing,
and sit on the fence! We have great audiences
here, our Cause is very strong in this country;
and yet there are only about 350 real members
(year 1870) in Adelaide; the faithful are few!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr to Mr. Carr: "I miss your wise
counsel and kind encouragement in the discharge
of duties. I would not wish to live without
you; I feel that I could not. I hope you
will write to Brother Albert Myles without
delay. In his present health, he must be
greatly crushed by the death of his brother.
If you do not take the rest you require, you
will go as perhaps Brother Albert is going.
The Lord bless Brothers Santo and Gore for
their goodness to you! Ollie, I wish you would
write more of what you feel, and less of what
you see. I want to know if you are any better,
and I want to know Dr. Campbell's opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
<i>in full</i>. Ettie and I enjoyed the annual meeting
of the deaf and dumb at the Town
Hall. We had a representation of a cricket
match; and the battle of Hastings. How did
you happen to write 'Six shillings are too much
for the book?' In my opinion you should have
said 'Six shillings are too <i>many</i>,' or, '<i>is</i> too
much.' I called on the American consul's wife;
both are pleasant people. I am still determined
to keep you in Tasmania two or three
months during the summer, even if I have to
keep lodgers."</p>

<p>Mr. Carr to Mrs. Carr: "I find no fault in
what you have written for the <i>Times</i>, why you
should not have it published. I return you
the MS. with my approval. Brother Gore and
I went by coach to a fine old English tavern at
Port Elliott where we staid till Saturday. I
got you some shells. We wandered over the
beautiful fields, gathering the wild flowers
daily, and hourly left our little (?) footprints
on the beach to be washed away. I wish you
could have seen that view! Mattie, do you
think I would let you stop at home and slave
away, for <i>me</i> to have all the fun, just because
of what Dr. Campbell says about one lung? I
am glad your birthday party passed off so well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Many thanks for the flowers from your
bouquet."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr to Mr. Carr: "I am sending you
an article for the <i>Times</i>, for you to criticise.
Return it to me and I will send it to Brother
McGarvey, as I want to write to him. If there
is anything in the article you disapprove, underline
it, and perhaps I will omit. That
which you cannot <i>tolerate</i>, doubly underline,
and I will certainly strike it out. Does the little
boy really cry for <i>you</i>, when you start for
town, or isn't it for Brother Gore? Thanks
for the nice flowers. I appreciate such a remembrance
from my 'prosy husband.' If Ettie
returns next year, I will keep you in Tasmania
for your health three months. She is
such a good girl, I love her more every day.
I miss you more than I can tell, darling; but I
have made up my mind to do what is best for
you. Brother Dick remembered you at morning
service, yesterday. It is after eleven now,
and I must read some French before I sleep."</p>

<p>Mr. Carr to Mrs. Carr: "I am sorry I wrote
you anything about Dr. Campbell's notion&mdash;I
believe you called it a 'diagnosis.' There is
nothing serious. My breathing is all right,&mdash;but
my <i>unbreathing</i> isn't perfect. But I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
think I'm coming round finely. I shall certainly
write to Albert Myles. Brother Santo
is teasing me&mdash;I can't write. He is such a jolly
good soul. He has been put up for the
Upper House, and is pretty sure to go in.
Much excitement about it. Brother Gore and
I tease him all the time."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr to Mr. Carr: "I still insist upon
that Tasmania trip. Sister Smith is confident
you can do much good there during your
two months' rest." (Sister Smith is the Jane
Nash, once a Catholic, whom Geo. Smith left
when he accepted his position in Tasmania.
Ever since the hatter went thither, he has
urged the Carrs to come and establish a Church
of Christ; now that he has married Jane, he
has a faithful ally in sending the call for help to
Melbourne.) "Expenses are running up, and
I have no way to meet the bills; but the
Lord has helped us in the past, and he will in
the future. Your trip to Adelaide has put us
in debt; but never mind, we will get out; just
now, we must restore my darling's health.
Your letter was read to the church last Lord's
day, and all were rejoiced at the improvement
of your health. They say it is a shame you
have never had a long rest after three constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
years of labor! They desire very much your
recovery, for they know how much depends
upon you at Collingwood. I am writing on
your table in Ettie's room. She occupies your
study and will till you return. Aren't we
saucy girls! But you will be so glad to see us,
you won't scold. My eyes are closing&mdash;so good
night, my love."</p>

<p>Mr. Carr to Mrs. Carr: "Had a long talk
with Sister &mdash;&mdash; . She is too despondent to
be a happy woman. There's no use in such a
thing as that. Be cheerful and happy! I wish
you were with me here at Two Wells. I was
at the Port yesterday, 7 miles away, and got
to fishing and got several bites, and came near
catching a fish. I had him near the top of the
boat, but he&mdash;" (Ah, yes!) "I am now at
North Adelaide, at Magarey's. Everybody in
the room is talking away, telling me what to
write&mdash;write this and that&mdash;'Tell Mrs. Carr
that joke on you,' etc. Such a pleasant visit!&mdash;talk,
music, etc., and I played drafts and
beat them badly every time, and then threatened
to beat my antagonist with the board.
Brother Thomas Magarey and I had a long
walk and talk. He is a fine man and is sorry
for ever having misunderstood me, and been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
led to think strange of us. He shows a great
interest in your work."</p>

<p>In the next chapter, we enter upon that
Tasmanian visit which was destined to be of
far greater proportions than Mrs. Carr at first
planned. As a final word on the life at Melbourne,
we quote from Mrs. Carr's diary,
when all were together in the work:</p>

<p>"My evening class as usual. Ollie is with his
Adelphian that he loves so well. How it has
grown in favor under his good and gentle guidance!
How delightful to see him yield a
Christian influence over the hearts of those
destined to become the pillars of the church!</p>

<p>"Took two young ladies to Chapel. They
had never seen a baptism before, and were favorably
impressed.</p>

<p>"Had a talk with my dear husband on the
Baptism of Jesus and John. How hard I try
to be worthy of Ollie!</p>

<p>"Ollie went to officers' meeting after preaching,
and came home after twelve, much exhausted.
Blessed Savior give him health and
strength, and keep me humble.</p>

<p>"Wrote to President Williams about my plan
for an Australian College. Blessed Savior,
give my husband strength to labor for Thee."</p>

<h3>EXPERIENCES IN TASMANIA.</h3>


<p>The following extracts from letters of
1872 furnish an interesting account
of the removal from Melbourne to
Hobart Town, Tasmania. Mr. Carr
writes to Mrs. Carr: "Arrived at
Lancaster, safe but sick, January 6th. We set
out for the Temperance Hotel, but it had become
intemperate and gorged with guests before
we got there. We went on, and have
struck a bargain with an old woman who
charges us one-six for each meal, and one-six
every time we sleep. I came near stealing a
march on my landlady by falling asleep this
afternoon without the old lady's knowing it.
Pretty high fare, but we are high up in the
second story. Called on a Church of England
acquaintance; he didn't invite me to his residence,
but asked me to his pew. The coach
doesn't leave for Hobart Town till Tuesday at
5 a. m. This place is just now taken by storm
by pleasure parties from Melbourne; I suppose
they will go on to Hobart Town. I am better
to-day. I do believe if I stayed here, I could
establish a church. The people are delighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
to hear of your teaching, and of your plan of
teaching. Shall I get you any boarding pupils?
I believe this climate will be good for me.</p>

<p>"January 10. We arrived at Hobart Town
last evening. Brother Smith was at the Coach
Office, by chance or providence. There were
48 passengers. It was a very large open coach
and we had a fine view of the country from
Launceston to Hobart. All the cabmen and
mischievous boys in the country flocked around
to see why such a big affair had come to town.
We were very cordially received by Brother and
Sister Smith, and after cocoa, went to bed,
and that was delightful, too. It is raining today,
and I feel wretchedly dull and bad. I can
hardly sit up.</p>

<p>"January 15. I do trust you are not discouraged.
I am not. Remember you are a
child of God, and all things work together for
your good. I believe I have come to Hobart
Town just at the right time, and the Lord will
bless my coming to the good of this people,
and the restoration of my health. I am enjoying
the hospitality of Brother and Sister Smith,
who show me every attention. She prepares
many nice things for me to eat, and he has
given me a fine new hat. I have a front room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
and a parlor all to myself, and the climate suits
me exactly. Brother Smith and I went to the
Baptist prayer meeting, and afterwards, they
insisted that I preach on Lord's day. They
asked me many questions, to which I returned
Scriptural answers; I told them all about the
church to which I belong, and what I preach;
and they agreed, and I came home on tiptoe.</p>

<p>"The next night I went to Town Hall where
the different preachers had been preaching all
week. Sunday morning I preached at the
Baptist chapel to a good audience. Then we
ate the Lord's supper. I insisted on the
ancient order of things&mdash;especially on meeting
the first day of the week to break bread.
They were delighted, and said I must preach
in their chapel whenever I wanted to speak.
There is a prayer meeting held every day at
noon, and preaching held three or four times a
week in the people's hall; but oh, they are so
benighted! They don't know the Gospel in its
beauty and power. I just burn to preach to
them. I will, if I get half a chance.</p>

<p>"January 20. I am called on from every
quarter to speak. All seem interested in my
sermons. Things look bright, now; but I fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
they will soon become prejudiced against the
truth.</p>

<p>"January 27. I agree with you about the
brick Chapel, and leave it all to you. I do
hope they will not put up a wooden one. But
they had better not have any Chapel, than to
quarrel over it. If the majority say a wooden
Chapel, a wooden one let it be. I don't believe
in the Collingwood Church's going down.
The faithful will remain faithful, despite a
Chapel. The people here are becoming enthusiastic.
Among my large audience Thursday
night, I had two preachers. The people
say they never heard such preaching in their
lives. I am trying to work them around on
Apostolic grounds. Now, Mattie, do not
think all for me, and nothing for yourself. I
could never forgive myself if I came here for
my health, and you overworked. Do not let
the building of the Chapel take too much of
your strength.</p>

<p>"February 6. Last Lord's day I spoke on <a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>'My Sheep' and there were about half a dozen
of the higher Calvinists&mdash;who own the Chapel&mdash;who
were not pleased. They will hold a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
church meeting next Thursday to decide
whether or not I am to preach in their Chapel
any more. Perhaps if they turn me out of
their place it will be for the best, because the
people who have been thronging there, do not
believe in Calvinism; I am sure none would take
steps to the Savior in that church, while I am
preaching. I could rent a hall for eight, a
week, and think after a while I can have a
church here. The people meet me on the street
and take me by the hand and say, 'I do wish
you were going to live here,' etc. Last Lord's
day, I spoke on the wharf to what is said to
have been the largest audience ever assembled
there. I am going to speak tonight at the
People's Hall. But you must not think, dear
Mattie, I am overdoing my strength; for it is
no harder to preach than to go out to tea and
talk.</p>

<p>"February 10. Great excitement in church
affairs. I preached on John 10:27, and the audience
was much interested, even excited, so
that they began to talk in the yard about the
absurdity of the church's bringing me to task.
But I went in to my trial. One of the deacons
made the motion that because I preached that
it was possible for one who had been converted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
to fall away and be lost, and because I said
that Christ died for all, the Chapel be no longer
tendered to me.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The motion was put, and
only this deacon and two others voted for it.
One man would not vote either way, and four
voted in the negative. The chairman announced
that I could use the Chapel when I
liked, only three being opposed. But I declined
to accept the offer, and yesterday tried
all day to get a place to preach in; but was told
in each place, "No, it would injure the other
congregations, by drawing away their members."
I am going to preach on the wharf tomorrow,
where I will have a larger audience
than I could ever have at the Chapel. The
cause of the Master will not be hurt by this opposition.
The editor of a weekly paper has
offered me one page to edit religiously, and
thus I will preach to the people. Brother and
Sister Smith and I sat up late last night talking
over the situation. She cried like a child
and he is so excited over the matter that he
doesn't know what to do. They will give us a
room as long as we can stay. You must come.</p>

<p>"February 11. To-day has been one of
great anxiety. As I could not get a hall to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
preach in, I thought it best to go to the Baptist
Chapel as a hearer. The deacon of whom
I wrote yesterday, preached in a vexing manner
and Brother Smith was highly wrought up
over the misrepresentations of my position. I
preached on the wharf to a large throng in the
afternoon, and at night heard a celebrated
Congregationalist. I was so disappointed at
passing one Lord's day evening without
preaching the Word, that I was unable to give
him a fair hearing. The people are in a furor
because I cannot get a place to preach in. One
lady whom I have never met, offers to give 5
toward erecting some sort of shed, that I may
have a place to preach. I am not discouraged.
Not even in Old Kentucky did I ever see so
much interest manifested. The Lord will surely
make some way here that his Truth may be
heard."</p>

<p>From Mrs. Carr to Mr. Carr: "My heart
is full of you and your mission, and prayers for
your success. I believe the Lord will bless
your efforts. I am determined that you shall
have a hall to preach in, I know you will
never sacrifice any of the fullness of the Gospel,
hence you cannot continue at the Baptist
Chapel. I send you 8 that you may rent a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
first-class hall. This I have borrowed, and I
would borrow for nothing but to further your
efforts in the Gospel. People ask me if you
have had any 'Results.' Do not write to any
one but me, of your labors, until you have had
what the people call 'Results,'&mdash;until at least
20 have obeyed the Gospel. I will pay your
rent until then, and after that you may be sure
of the hearty co-operation of the churches. It is
the <i>work performed</i> that determines the value
of any instrumentality. At least, that is the
opinion of the churches; and their idea of work
performed is embodied in '<i>Converts</i>,' or, as
some say, '<i>Results</i>.' And they are not wholly
wrong. Don't write to others about your work
until you have success. The 8 will rent a
hall for two months at 1 per week, and by
that time you will certainly have some 'Results.'
But don't forget to take care of my darling's
health. I do trust that your success will be
such that you can stay three months longer.
A gentleman we met in London at Mr. Murby's,
called with letters and papers from Mrs.
Murby. She says we must make up our minds
to a long stay with her in London, on our return
to Kentucky."</p>

<p>We resume Mr. Carr's letters to Mrs. Carr:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
"I have done it. I have rented one of the best
places in the city, Odd Fellows' Hall, for 13-9
per week, including cleaning, gas, etc. Am
now at the printing office getting out posters.
We are to have six hymns printed for
next Lord's day. I will ask baptized believers
to remain after the sermon, to see how many
members of the church there will be. Tell
Brother Dick to send 50 hymn books, with bill.
And tell him to send my baptizing suit in the
same box.</p>

<p>"February 19. Our first day at the hall was
a very successful one. The house was crowded
and the people stood at the door. Poor Brother
Smith is hardly able to contain himself for
joy. On Tuesday we meet to organize a
church. Don't forget to send that baptizing
suit.</p>

<p>"February 20. To-night (Tuesday) we met
in a side room of the Odd Fellows' Hall and
talked on the basis of union. I answered their
questions, and we had a happy time. Then I
asked all to hold up their hands who were in
favor of taking simply the New Testament as
their rule of faith and practice, and nearly
every one held up his hand. Fifteen of those
who had been baptized, gave me their names,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
pledging themselves to live by the Word of
God. So you see, we have a start even in
Hobart Town.</p>

<p>"February 27. Lord's day evening the hall
was crowded; some stood, some sat on the
floor. There are some candidates for baptism,
but a difficulty has arisen. The three who objected
to my preaching, do not want to let me
have the use of the baptistry. They have called
a church meeting to which I am invited to
explain what I make of baptism.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> In the
morning we met at the hall to break bread, so
I regard the church as begun in Hobart Town.
Our collection from the 15 who have taken
their stand with us, was 1-6-0 last Lord's day
morning. Pretty good for a start, isn't it? I
will soon be able to return that money you borrowed.
There is no communion service in Hobart
Town, and I had to send to Melbourne
for one.</p>

<p>"March 5. Our evening audiences are increasing,
but only a few meet to break bread in
the morning. The people are so ignorant of
everything pertaining to Christianity, that I
have to teach them as if they were children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
sure enough. Many never heard of what I
preach; and while they admit the truth of it,
they stand aloof. About 500 read each week
my religious page of the <i>Advance</i>. That is
better than tracts. Come to Tasmania! I am
sure you could do a good work here, and this
climate would restore your health. We will
treat you, oh so well! Let me know when to
expect you, and I will go out and sit on the
wharf and wait for you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr to Mr. Carr: "The <i>Southern
Cross</i> leaves Melbourne the 26th of March, the
anniversary of our wedding. I wish we could
be together in Hobart Town on that day. I
will bring my piano. If you are on the wharf
at 6:30 Thursday morning you will see your
wife. But I'll not expect you there, for I remember
your motto&mdash;'He who cannot rest his
head upon his pillow and enjoy his forty morning
winks, is up to knavery, or else he drinks!'
At the tea meeting everybody asked about you,
and expressed joy at your success. The brethren
are delighted that you have established a
church in Tasmania. No, I will not bring Sister
Smith a half dozen <i>reams</i> of cotton; paper
is sold by the ream; but thread by the gross;
perhaps you meant reels. It does seem strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
that in less than a week, I'll see my husband!
I scarcely know how I'll behave myself! An
appeal was made to the Lygon street church
for assistance to Collingwood, in the erection
of a brick chapel. All thoughts of a wooden
building have been abandoned, and harmony
is prevailing. I am sure I'll get pupils on the
piano and guitar when we are established at
Hobart Town. President Williams' last words
to me were, '<i>Only believe</i>, Mattie, and the
light of his face will always shine upon you.'
I believe the Lord will open a way for our support,
if not through my labors, in some other
way. I am going to have your faith, Ollie,
and I know I'll be happy. Take good care of
yourself. I'm sure you work too hard. Remember
your work and your wife, and <i>take
care of your health</i>!"</p>

<p>The reader who has followed the preceding
pages does not need to be told why the Carrs
finally left Australia. The admonition which
each constantly gave the other&mdash;"Take care of
your health,"&mdash;could not be observed. Even
on holidays, as we have seen, hard work came
pressing at the door; and the climate was never
favorable to the constitution of the missionaries.
They left, at last; but the Collingwood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
Church established through their efforts, remains
to perpetuate their influence. At Hobart
Town, success came in spite of active opposition.
When Mr. Carr was challenged with
the inquiry, 'What do you think is the design
of baptism?'&mdash;his reply was as follows:</p>

<p>"'He that believes and is baptized shall be
saved.' That is what the Savior says. That
is what I think."</p>

<p>This reply was so unsatisfactory that he was
refused the use of the baptistry. The town,
less scrupulous in its views, proffered the use of
public baths. The public would assemble upon
the porch of the bathroom, and, in the salt
water, the converts would be immersed. It
was not in vain that Mr. Carr preached on
"My sheep hear my voice." The entire Baptist
Church with the exception of six came to the
congregation at the rented hall. At the end
of three months, Mrs. Carr joined her husband.
During the year in Tasmania, they lived with
the Smiths. Mrs. Carr taught music, and she
and Mrs. Smith made sailors' caps and sold
them to help on with the missionary work.
Whaling ships came in there, and the demand
for sailors' caps was unceasing.</p>

<p>But while Mrs. Carr thus lived in partial seclusion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
sewing and teaching music lessons, her
thoughts reached far beyond the straitened
opportunities of the colonies. Five years from
the native land had resulted so far as visible results
went, in the establishment of two
churches, one in Melbourne, one in Hobart
Town. Such accomplishments were well worth
the sacrifices they had demanded, but they
were achievements aside from those definite
ideals which she had formed at the beginning
of her school life. Her boarding school in Melbourne
had done much good, but it was not a
permanent institution; with her departure, it
passed away; and she was resolved that out of
her life should come a monumental school,
which, though she departed, should remain.
Her plans conflicted with her husband's intense
zeal for souls, hence she quietly worked away
at sailors' caps, and agreed, if he thought best,
to go next to New Zealand for the Cause. But
at last, when it became manifest that his
health demanded a rest from work too great
for even a strong man, and a decided change
of climate, she declared for a return to America.
To go back meant not only the probable
regaining of his health, but the carrying out
of her educational ambitions; and in order the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
better to perfect herself in her chosen work,
and to secure the needed rest for both, she resolved
that they should spend the next year in
travel, studying the countries of the Orient,
and dwelling among the hills round about
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Mr. Carr to Mrs. Carr, from Hobart Town,
January 17, 1873: "Last night we had our
Tea Meeting and oh! such a Tea it was!
Everybody seemed pleased with everything but
one abominably long address. The speech of
the evening had much about you; 'a lady of
such rare abilities,' 'your condescension in
coming amongst them,' 'they would never find
your equal,' etc. The good you have done,
your kindness to all, your talents, were dwelt
upon by nearly every speaker. Poor Brother
Jones could hardly restrain his feelings. He
said he had never seen your like. The singing
was splendid. The room was most tastefully
decorated. 'Farewell to Brother and Sister
Carr for a season,' and 'Welcome to Brother
G. B. Moysey,' were the letters hanging
about." (Mr. Carr's successor at Hobart
Town was that Moysey who had sold his calf
for learning.) "After Brother Moysey's first
sermon on Lord's day, there was one confession.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
It was a grand sermon,&mdash;he is just the
man for the place and I am sure will do
a splendid work here. Everybody sends
love to you. I am so excited, I'm ill. I do
hate to go from here. I never knew before
how much I thought of this people. I have
spent three days taking Brother Moysey around
to see the people in their homes. I am so sorry
to hear of your illness. Take good care of
your health. Love to Brothers Gore, Santo,
and everybody&mdash;dear me! I can write no more."</p>

<h3>TRAVELS IN THE ORIENT.</h3>


<p>An account of one's travels in lands far
from the scene of one's life-work, has
no proper place in biography, unless
such travels reveal or develop characteristics
of the traveler. No matter
how wide-spread may be the interest in the
countries traversed, the biographer has no
right to convey his reader from land to land,
simply because the feet of his subject have gone
on before. We would, therefore, pass over the
oriental experiences of Mr. and Mrs. Carr with
but a word, if we did not have before us extensive
notes on the journey, in Mrs. Carr's
own hand.</p>

<p>The fact that she wrote of her experiences,
makes them at once of biographical value, for
we are enabled to observe the reaction of peoples
and countries upon her own mind. While it is
true that these notes were made that she might
tell others what she had seen, it must be remembered
that they were not intended for
publication.</p>

<p>"On a beautiful May morning, the pet
steamer of the Peninsular and Oriental Line,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
with all canvas spread, was skimming the
smooth waters of the Indian Ocean. No albatross
of ill-omen hovered round our ship. The
passengers, light-hearted and joyous, were
chatting under the awning,&mdash;when the man at
the wheel shouted, 'Fire! fire!'</p>

<p>"At that awful word, every man of the crew
was at his post, while pale passengers stared at
each other, fainting women fell into trembling
arms, and the children caught the contagion of
fear. Suddenly our Captain turned his wide-mouthed
trumpet upon us and shouted:</p>

<p>"'Ladies and gentlemen, I beg your pardon;
the crew is on a fire drill!' Those who had
fainted, never forgave him for his failure to
notify them of what was to happen.</p>

<p>"A night of excitement succeeded. About
ten o'clock, while we were on deck, enjoying
the balmy air of the tropics, the sharp report
of a pistol was heard, its flash gleamed for an
instant on the waters,&mdash;and a suicide had cast
a gloom over all. A night of watching by the
dead passed, and at the rising of the sun we
witnessed a burial at sea. The body, enclosed
in a canvas sack and weighted with iron, was
laid upon a latticed bier close to the opened
gangway. It was held in place by two guards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
lest, even in that calm sea, a sudden tilt of the
ship send it into its grave before the time.
The service of the Church of England was read;
then the body fell heavily into the waters, there
to remain until the coming of that sound which
is to penetrate even the depths of old ocean.</p>

<p>"A few days sail brought us to the luxuriant
shores of Ceylon. We spent several days driving
over the beautiful island, through cocoanut
and banana groves and cinnamon gardens, inhaling
the spicy breezes, and sorrowing over
the degradation of the people.</p>

<p>"From this beautiful but sin-cursed isle, our
ship soon brought us through the straits of
Bab-el-Mandeb, and anchored at Aden, on the
barren shores of Arabia. Near Aden are situated
the immense tanks holding millions of
gallons of water, without which the land would
be uninhabitable. Continuing our voyage up
the Red Sea, we passed Mocha, renowned for
its coffee, and in due time arrived at the gate-entrance
of the great Sinaitic Peninsula,&mdash;Suez.</p>

<p>"Suez, washed upon one side by the sea, is
encircled upon the others by the barren wastes
of the desert. No tree, shrub, or blade of
grass, relieves the gloomy sterility of the landscape.
We hasten on by rail. Soon a long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
low line of water appears, just beside the railroad
track. Behold, it is the Nile&mdash;that river
cradled in the depths of mysterious caverns,
forcing its way through granite ledges and
mountain barriers, rushing over cataracts,
foaming through narrows, then flowing gently
onward, singing amid perpetual sunshine,
until it empties by its seven mouths into the
great blue sea. A river which has a place in
history by the side of the Euphrates and the
Jordan; a river which the Egyptians worshiped,
and the miracle of whose waters made a
Pharaoh tremble; a river on whose banks perished
Thebes with her hundred gates, and
Memphis with her monuments; a river that
has seen the coming of Ethiopian and Persian,
Macedonian and Roman, Saracen and Turk,
in fulfillment of the curse God spoke through
Ezekiel.</p>

<p>"After stopping at numerous stations where
we were greeted by sights, sounds, and odors
peculiar to the coarse civilization of the Orient,
the minarets of Cairo and the pyramids of
Gizeh looked down upon us. After a minute
examination of the pyramids" (I omit a
thoughtful and logical disquisition on the various
problems presented by these monuments)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
"we drove back to Cairo under the grateful
shade of the lebbekh trees, over a fine macadamized
road, built in 1868 in honor of the Prince
and Princess of Wales. After a pleasant and
profitable talk with the American consul, who
kindly came to bring us our passports, and
to invite us to dine with him, we reviewed, as
usual, the scenes of the day, and rested as only
weary sight-seers can rest.</p>

<p>"Early the next morning, we drove through
the Esbekeeyah, the Corso of Cairo, on our
way to Heliopolis. It is easily identified from a
distance by the oldest obelisk in Egypt, bearing
the name of the founder of the XXII. dynasty.
In Scripture, Heliopolis is called On.
Moses is said to have studied here, and Joseph's
father-in-law was a priest of its renowned
temple. Here Plato lived for thirteen years.
It seems to have been literally a city of obelisks,
for it furnished all that have been transported
to Europe. Its destruction was prophesied by
Ezekiel.</p>

<p>"The way to the magnificent palace of Shoobra
lies along a beautiful avenue of sycamore,
fig, and acacia. The Shoobra road is the
'Rotten Row' of Cairo. It is perhaps the most
republican promenade in the world. No vehicle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
or animal is excluded. The Khedive and
his outriders are jostled in most unseemly fashion
by bare-boned donkeys whipped along by
ragged urchins. Ministers, consuls, bankers,
money-changers, speculators, singers, actors,
ballet-dancers, adventurers, and not least conspicuous,
English-speaking tourists, form a
curious medley. After a drive to the tombs of
the Caliphs through sand that buried our carriage
wheels almost to the hub, we spent a
pleasant evening with the American consul and
his accomplished wife in their beautiful oriental
home, then slept the dreamless sleep of the
weary traveler.</p>

<p>"In the early morning we mounted our
donkeys which were ornamented gorgeously in
oriental style. These donkeys, in honor of our
nativity, had been christened Uncle Sam and
Yankee Doodle. We expressed our appreciation
of such patriotic names, when, lo! almost
every donkey in Cairo, in the neighborhood of
our hotel was suddenly transformed into an
Uncle Sam or a Yankee Doodle. But Mr.
Carr and I would not desert the first of the
name.</p>

<p>"I wish you could have seen us flying along
the Nile at the rate of the Western Lightning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Express, Eli, without either bridle or mane to
cling to, our English tongues crying, 'Stop!
stop!'&mdash;which the Arab ears of our muleteers
interpreted into, 'Faster! faster!' Our muleteers
were very accommodating fellows, and
their interpretation encouraged them to renewed
efforts to increase the speed of our
donkeys, by applying, every thirty seconds, a
sharp-pointed steel instrument. Our English-speaking
dragoman was too far ahead to hear
our cries of distress as we rocked in the cradle
of (on) the donkey.</p>

<p>"After an hour's most exciting ride, we dismounted
at the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities.
Here is a mummy coffin, whose hieroglyphics
demonstrate that the ancient Egyptians
had a conception of hell and heaven, and
a belief in the immortality of the soul. There
is an inscription proving that the Sphinx existed
before the time of Cheops; and that even
then, the people were rich and civilized. Here
are ancient knives, scissors, needles, etc., but
nothing is made of iron, which they thought a
bone of their evil genius. Here on exhibition
are the magnificent jewels found on the mummy
of Queen Aoh-Hotep, the mother of the first
king of the XVIII. dynasty.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here can be found the confirmation of many
narratives of the Old Testament. The first
great event in the Kingdom of Judah, after its
separation, was the invasion of Shishak, king
of Egypt. According to the sacred record,
Shishak came against Jerusalem with 1,200
chariots and 60,000 horsemen, took the fenced
cities, and was about to invest the capital,
when Rehoboam made his submission.</p>

<p>"On the outside of the great temple at Karnak,
hieroglyphics commemorate the success of
Shishak against Judah, and records a long list
of captured towns&mdash;the fenced cities of Scripture.
The picture Moses gives of a Pharaoh
ruling over an absolute monarchy, finds confirmation
in the ancient Egyptian tombs. From
vast numbers of papyri, we learn in detail of
that old civilization&mdash;records which even Herodotus
was not able to read.</p>

<p>"In these we find a counterpart of the picture
of that country presented by Moses. After a
slumber of 3,000 years, these records present
the people prostrating themselves, the laborers
storing away grain, the baker with his three
baskets upon his head, the brickyards with
Jewish laborers supervised by Egyptian taskmasters,
etc.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the Museum of Antiquities are statues
of kings and queens who lived in the era between
Moses and Abraham. In front of them
is an immense glass case in which is deposited
their crown jewels, artistically executed.
Among them is a massive gold chain, more exquisitely
beautiful than anything I saw in the
Tower, among Victoria's crown jewels, unless
I except the Kohinoor. It was more beautiful
than the jeweled swordhilt, breast plate or
crown of the Shah of Persia, worn at his reception
at Milan, though they represented
nearly half the wealth of his kingdom.</p>

<p>"Thus it is proved that in the era in which
Joseph received the chain of gold from Pharaoh,
such chains, of rare workmanship, were already
in vogue. Less than a century ago, critics
were hurling their shafts of contempt against
the so-called blunders of Moses; but monumental
history substantiates his credibility.
Truly, Egypt is one of God's historic books.
His handwriting is on temple and tablet and
tomb. Here dead men speak, and stones rise
up to testify. Bricks of unburnt clay, torn up
from the ruins of centuries, tell of Israel's bondage
and labor.</p>

<p>"Of course we went to the bazaars and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
parks, cathedrals and mosques, the missionary
schools, and the College of Cairo&mdash;the principal
University of the East. And then to
Alexandria&mdash;to which the ancient city has, indeed,
bequeathed nothing but its name.
Though earth and sea have remained unchanged,
imagination can scarcely find a place
for the ancient walls. Little vestige remains
of the magnificent days of the Ptolomies and
the Csars.</p>

<p>"One-fourth of the population is foreign; the
city seethes with the scum of all the cities of the
Mediterranean. Here luxury and literature,
the Epicurean and the Christian, dwelt together;
but now, in the Oriental part, one finds
only dirty, narrow, tortuous streets, mud-colored
buildings with terraced roofs, varied by
fat mosques with lean minarets.</p>

<p>"Here once stood the renowned library of
antiquity. Here the Hebrew Scriptures expanded
into Greek under the hands of the Septuagint.
Here Cleopatra, '<i>Vainquer des
vainquer du monde</i>' reveled with the Roman
conqueror; here Mark preached the truth upon
which Origen attempted to refine; here Athenasius
held warlike controversy; here Amer
conquered, and here Abercrombie fell.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>
<p>"In company with our intelligent dragoman,
we sailed from Alexandria on a Russian steamship,
and, after a voyage of a day and a half,
beheld the queer stone city of Joppa, with its
fort-like houses rising tier above tier on the
hillside.</p>

<p>"I cannot describe the enthusiasm we felt at
the thought that we were at last to walk upon
the soil hallowed by the feet of patriarchs,
prophets and apostles and to visit the scenes
where they lived, labored, and communed with
God. We walked through the winding, slanting
streets of Joppa, and called at the house of
Simon the tanner.</p>

<p>"So well preserved were the vats of his tannery
that one would hardly have been surprised
to find the distinguished guest of Simon
walking on the housetop in the twilight. But
we must confess that we could not identify this
house by the description given in the tenth
chapter of Acts.</p>

<p>"Leaving Joppa early in the afternoon, in a
German spring-wagon, and passing through
the only gate on the land side, we set our faces
toward the Holy City. Gardens and orchards,
groves of orange, fig, and pomegranate, made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
the country delightful. Our road lay directly
across the plain of Sharon.</p>

<p>"Isaiah prophesied that Sharon should be a
wilderness, and the black huts of the Bedouin
tell the fulfillment of that prediction. We look
in vain for the beautiful flower to which Solomon
likened his beloved. But although man
is no longer regaled by its fragrance, the true
Rose of Sharon still unfolds its charms to every
believer, whether he be a child of the plain, or
the mountain.</p>

<p>"We passed by Ludd, and refreshed ourselves
at the Arimathea of Joseph. We approached
the hillside village of Kirjath-jearim,
with its terraces of olives and fig trees. Leaving
the valley of Ajalon, the rough macadamized
road led us up the rocky sides of Judea's
hills. We traveled nearly all night; and, just
as we reached the highest point in the road,
between the sea and the river, the rising sun
unveiled to us the minarets and domes and
massive walls of Jerusalem. I cannot tell you
how inspiring, how deep, were the emotions
that came crowding upon brain and heart.</p>

<p>"When we were about five miles from the
city, a young man, mounted upon a beautiful
Arab steed, brought us to a halt, with a courteous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
wave of his hand, and, in broken English,
presented us with the card of the Mediterranean
Hotel. We learned that the proprietor
was a convert of Dr. Barclay, and decided
to make his house our home during our stay.
In a little while we entered the Joppa gate amid
cries of squalid beggars, and, a few yards from
that entrance, dismounted before our hotel.
It stands on Mt. Zion, in the shadow of the
Tower of David, and here we received that cordial
welcome accorded to those willing to pay
$3 a day.</p>

<p>"Standing on the heights of Mt. Zion with
your face to the east, you have before you the
Tyropeon Valley, now so full of debris as
scarcely to appear as a valley. Looking
a little to the north you behold Mt. Moriah
where now stand the Dome of the Rock and the
Mosque of El Akra. Beyond these to the east,
is the deep Valley of Jehosaphat with the brook
Kedron and the supposed Garden of Gethsemane,
and beyond rises the beautiful summit
of the Mount of Olives. Northward is Akra,
and east of it Bezetha, two of the hills on which
the city originally stood, and a part of which it
still covers.</p>

<p>"We have lingered at Bethesda, whence the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
angel has departed; at Siloam's fountain; at
the Wailing Place where the Jews, every Friday
afternoon, lament in the language of their
poets, the misfortunes of their people; at the
Dome of the Rock with its marvelous Moslem
wonders; at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre,
that centre of enslaving superstition, whose
annual triumphs cast a ray of hope adown the
narrow halls of the Vatican. Through a hole
in the wall of the Chapel of Angelo, a torch is
annually passed out, supposedly lighted by fire
from heaven. The pilgrims wait in the darkness
with wax tapers, to be lighted from celestial
fire. The devotees bathe their hands in
the flame, to secure a special blessing; and the
extinguished tapers are carried to 20,000 distant
homes, to be as devoutly reverenced as
the pilgrims who carry them.</p>

<p>"There is nothing in the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre that is not saddening to the heart of
the enlightened. Through our visit to this
building we had the honor of making the acquaintance
of the Bishop of Jerusalem, and receiving
from him diplomas testifying to our
Oriental travel. I fear I should forfeit mine
could he know my unorthodox opinions of the
'sacred spots' of the Church.</p>

<p>"I loved to walk along the Via Dolorosa, to
visit the home of Mary and Martha. I wept
under the shade of Gethsemane's gnarled olive
trees; I climbed to the summit of Olivet, and
listened to the French prattle of the Countess
de Bouillon; I took a donkey ride over the hills
of Judea; I lunched in the shadow of the rock
where the man who went down from Jerusalem
to Jericho, fell among thieves; I tented in the
valley of the Jordan with the Stars and Stripes
and the Crescent and the Star waving above;
I stood on the whitened shores of the Salt Sea,
and gathered dead sea apples along the shady
banks of the Sacred River; I had a cooling
draught from Elisha's Fountain at the foot of
the Mount of Temptation; and in the shadow
of Mount Tabor, I thought I heard the angel
of death calling me to another Canaan. The
flowered slopes of cedared Lebanon, the
snowy top of Hermon, the clear waters of
Abana, the ivy of old Damascus, Tyre and
Sidon, Mt. Carmel and Nazareth&mdash;in short,
from Dan to Beersheba, we saw all.</p>

<p>"And for all the Holy Land, the most accurate
guide-book the traveler can have, even to
this day, is the Old Testament. So perfect is
the agreement of the land and the Book, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
frequently when standing upon some elevated
spot in Palestine one could read the story of
Joshua, Judges and Samuel, and follow accurately
with the eye the movements from place
to place, as readily as on a modern map.</p>

<p>"Since the first siege of Jerusalem by Joshua
thirty-three centuries ago, it has undergone
twenty-six sieges, and in almost one-third of
these, the city was utterly devastated. The
great explorer, Captain Warren, has sunk
shafts through the immense mass of debris accumulated
at the wall penetrating stratum
after stratum of debris of successive devastations.</p>

<p>"Descending eighty feet, he found the road
that used to lead from the gate, in the time of
Herod. Sixty feet farther down, was discovered
the road of the time of Solomon. In the
foundation-stones were found the marks of
the quarries of Tyre. They came upon the
arches of the viaduct, that, in the days of Solomon,
connected the palace with the temple.</p>

<p>"There is no discord between the voice of
the ruins, and the voice of inspiration. These
wonderful voices of the dead, coming not alone
from Egypt and Palestine, but from the exhumed
capitals of Assyria and Babylonia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
awakened after a score and a quarter centuries
of silence, bear testimony in unmistakable tones
that 'Jehovah is God, Jehovah is God alone.'"</p>

<h3>WORK IN KENTUCKY AND MISSOURI.</h3>


<p>The five years following the return
to America were years of transition,
of experiment. Mrs. Carr was, as
always, bent upon devoting her energies
to educational work, and Mr.
Carr was content to preach in whatever surroundings
might be best adapted to her talents.</p>

<p>Fortunate is he who discovers anywhere in
the world, a situation which calls for the exercise
of all his highest faculties; usually such a
setting must be made, fashioned from a part of
that energy which, might, if not thus deflected
from creative work, have wrought the more.</p>

<p>It was so with Mrs. Carr. Endowed with
gifts of high order, gifts that the world always
needs, she had not, as yet, found the vantage
ground for their full exercise; nor was she ever
to find that highest development, until she had
fashioned from her own heart and brain, the
battle-ground of service.</p>

<p>As yet, she did not know this, but sought in
various fields for a ready-prepared equipment,
a sword sharpened, and a breast plate polished
by other hands, with which she might fight for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
the truth. Returning from Australia she
naturally looked about in Kentucky for the
background of her ideals. It was not to be
found there, and she came presently to Missouri;
first to Fulton, then to Columbia.</p>

<p>She entered into various school relationships,
but we find her restless in association with
presidents whose ideas of school-government
were different from her own. We trust the following
extracts from letters will prove of interest
in themselves, and at the same time tell the
story of these years in the words of those who
were chief actors.</p>

<p>May 27, 1874, about eight months after the
return from Australia, A. B. Jones writes to
Mr. Carr from Madison Female Institute,
Richmond, Kentucky: "If I should conclude
to resign here, would it be worth while to nominate
you and Mrs. Carr for the position?"&mdash;which
shows that Mrs. Carr is making no delay
in seeking her sharpened sword and polished
armor.</p>

<p>She is in fact, impatient in the search, as
witness this to her from Mr. Carr, May 27th:
"I am having big audiences at Sycamore, Kentucky.
At the conclusion of the sermon, last
night, eleven came forward. You must try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
be reconciled with your lot until next fall.
This constant moving about from place to
place, is best for the present. As to Hocker
College, they want you and I will hold myself
liable to an engagement at Cincinnati, for my
wife's sake. Do not worry over the matter.
Teaching must be attended to, just as the institutions
of baptism and the Lord's supper.
I am sure you will be one of the happiest women
in the world, if you are settled at work;
and this shall be, if we are spared to see next
fall."</p>

<p>He writes again, June 25th: "Your letter
came yesterday. A man named Carr, opened
it by mistake, and when he saw that ribbon
and those flowers, he must have thought it
from somebody's sweetheart,&mdash;and so it was!
Brother Crenshaw has a flourishing Ladies'
College at Hopkinsville. These institutions
have sprung up rapidly in Kentucky. Here at
Princeton is another. Warrendale College at
Georgetown is to be sold for debt. From all I
can see, these Colleges do not promise much.
I am sure a certainty at Hocker is preferable to
an uncertainty elsewhere."</p>

<p>Extract from the <i>Kentucky Gazette</i>, Lexington,
Ky., August 18, 1874: "On the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Monday of September, Hocker College"
(of which Robt. Graham was President) "will
begin its sixth annual session. The immense
outlay of more than $100,000 has made the
building perfectly adapted to its purposes.
To the faculty of the fall term has been added
Mrs. O. A. Carr, a Christian woman of untiring
energy, and zeal in the education of women.
She is a graduate of St. Catherine de Sienna
and Daughters' College and holds a Traveling
Diploma from the Bishop of Jerusalem. She
purposes delivering a series of lectures, extending
through the collegiate year, upon the wonders
of many lands. She is eminently qualified
as an educator and disciplinarian for the position
of Principal in Hocker College."</p>

<p>M. W. Green, writing from Australia,
throws a confirmatory light on why the Carrs
were obliged to return to America: "You say
you are so busy you find it difficult to get time
to write. It is to be hoped that in doing so
much you will not again overtax yourself, and
bring on another time of weakness. I am beginning
to feel somewhat as you did, before
you left Melbourne. Nature is beginning to
wear out, and calls for a rest. I cannot get
that rest on land, for if I see an opportunity to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
preach, I feel myself unfaithful if I do not avail
myself of it. Sometimes I think I will never
get a rest unless I take a long sea-voyage. It
must be hard for you to have your study in
Lexington, and your books in Hobart Town.
Brother Earl writes me of his sorrow at hearing
that protracted meetings are being introduced
into Australia. 'They,' he says, 'often
bring unconverted people into the church; and
they are discouraging to the regular preacher,
for the people get into the way of not uniting
with the church, except at the exciting time of
a protracted meeting.' We are pleased that
Sister Carr has obtained so good a place for
usefulness as the one at Hocker. We had
Brother Magarey over in Melbourne to preach
for us. I was much pleased with him, both as
to piety and ability. His style much resembles
your own, and I cannot tell his handwriting
from yours." (This was the miller's son, Alex.,
whose brother practiced medicine and religion,
as we have seen.)</p>

<p>While Mrs. Carr is teaching at Hocker, Mr.
Carr writes to her from Vanceburg: "I cannot
tell when I will be home; this is the time
for work. I would be miserable hanging about
Hocker College, doing nothing, and you hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
at work. I will hold two or three meetings before
I return. Miller is blazing away at Greenup;
he is giving me a drumming, I hear; but
he can't hurt me. I understand that Brother
Sweeny has agreed to debate with Miller. I
can assist your young ladies on the Argonautic
Expedition as well from here, as if I were with
them. I advise them to write sensible essays,
and have their papers strictly original. This
advice is all I could offer them, no matter where
I am. This is an odd place. The farmers
bring their produce to town every other day,
which consists of a few bundles of hoop-poles
for barrels, and these they trade for something
to eat. They leave the city with a long slice of
fat bacon under the arm, and a little bag of
flour, enough to sustain their families for the
next day. Then they come, and go again. I
am amused at the merchants, who give their
goods for poles, tar and tanbark, and then run
cooper-shops in connection with their dry goods
and bacon. One of our sisters here is a milliner.
She says she doesn't take tanbark in
trade for bonnets, but she has ladies' hats for
ten cents a piece, and carries on a lively trade.
Don't you want me to bring you up here, to do
some shopping?"</p>

<p>We learn from the following that Mrs. Carr
found one year at Hocker College (now called
Hamilton College) enough to convince her that
it did not afford the opportunities she sought;
the letter is to the Trustees of the Midway
Orphan School, and is written by Robert Graham,
May 10, 1875: "Having heard that there
will be a vacancy in the principalship of your
institution, it gives me pleasure to say that
Sister Carr has been associated with me in
Hocker College during the session now coming
to a close, and that she is a lady peculiarly
fitted to have charge of girls in the classroom
and in daily life. She is a lady of refinement,
intellectual culture, and energy. I think her
conscientiousness, experience, and religious devotion,
point her out as one raised of God to
do a great work in the intellectual world, and
spiritual education of women."</p>

<p>September 9, 1875, Mrs. Carr, now at her
old home town, Stanford, receives a letter from
John Augustus Williams: "If you had consulted
me as a daughter should consult a father,
you would have saved yourself some trouble.
I received several letters from the Missouri
Orphan School recently; they wrote for my
advice regarding teachers,&mdash;but I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
you engaged at Hocker College. School must
be in session now, so it is too late. But you
and Ollie, having no children, ought to be in
charge of that school. It is 150 pupils strong.
What to do this session? Well, address yourself
to study, and prepare yourself to take
charge of your sister-women in any branch.
Daughters College is full. Over 100 boarders
have applied, and we cannot take them. You
and Ollie come to see me. Yes, come <i>home</i>,
and let's have a talk!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr was never associated with the
Missouri Orphan School, but she was convinced
that Missouri offered her better opportunities
than Kentucky. Accordingly, when in the fall
of this same year, Mr. Carr was called to preach
for the 17th and Olive Street Church, at St.
Louis, it meant a final departure from the state
of their birth, so far as permanent work was
concerned.</p>

<p>At the St. Louis Church, Mr. Carr was the
successor of Dr. W. H. Hopson, and the predecessor
of T. P. Haley. It was an interesting
and a critical time in the history of the St.
Louis Churches. J. H. Garrison of the Central
Church was laboring night and day to
keep the infant <i>Christian</i> upon its feet. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
faithful members of both congregations stood
loyally by the little weekly, and took their turns
in ministering to the mission churches, such as
that at 13th and Webster.</p>

<p>Of the Church for which Mr. Carr preached,
there were three elders, who were interested in
this missionary work: John G. Allen, the
father-in-law of Albert Myles; Dr. Hiram Christopher,
former teacher of Chemistry at Bethany
and author of "The Remedial System" as
we have seen; and Dr. J. W. Ellis, who practiced
law during the day, taught in Jones's
Business College at night, preached on Sunday
afternoons, wrote "Jarvis Jeems" articles for
the <i>Christian</i> between times, and edited the
St. Louis Ladies Magazine.</p>

<p>The matter of finding board for Mr. and
Mrs. Carr was a difficult one. Albert Myles
and his family lived with J. G. Allen, hence
Mrs. Allen did not feel that she could receive
an additional family, however congenial. In
the end the Carrs went to her hospitable home,
but for some time they lived with Dr. and Mrs.
J. W. Ellis.</p>

<p>To this association of a month, the present
writer owes his personal knowledge of Mrs.
Carr. He had never seen her until the fall of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
1875, he never saw her after the spring of 1876.
Inasmuch as his sixth birthday fell within
those extremes of time, he cannot be expected
to speak of Mrs. Carr's mental and spiritual
characteristics, from his own observation. He
remembers her, however, not as a mere name,
or as a vague shadow of the past, but with
clear-cut distinctness. Of all the women who
flitted through his boyhood days never to reappear,
Mrs. Carr's personality stands forth
best defined.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because she had no children
of her own, that she was able to impress children,
from the interest she had in the children
of other people,&mdash;her absorbing thoughtfulness
for youth itself. This was with her no
transient pastime, but belonged to that deeper
part of her nature which started the stinging
tear at little bits of childhood-verses. Her
manner with children was not gay and buoyant,
but gentle and untiring.</p>

<p>The child felt that her interest did not spring
from impulse, to pass with the hour, but that
whenever he should be ready, he would find
her. In that inherent dignity and seriousness
of her natural character, kindliness for the
young shone with a steady light which, if it did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
not flash out in sudden radiant mirth, remained
unclouded from any other interest.</p>

<p>Those who have proved restive under Mrs.
Carr's unrelaxing discipline, those who may have
opposed her in school management, those whom
she has faced from the public rostrum in state
addresses with logical argumentation, may have
found in her a fearlessness that seemed at times
the indication of an imperious and unyielding
disposition. Doubtless those who opposed her
were unable to understand the wounded heart
behind the stern, accusing eye. But however
brave and determined, there was one thing she
feared,&mdash;to wound the heart of a child.</p>

<p>During Mr. Carr's ministry in St. Louis,
Mrs. Carr devoted herself to study and travel.
A large composition book, filled to the last
page, shows her indefatigable labors with the
German language, under the guidance of Dr.
J. W. Ellis. In 1876, she went to the Centennial
Exposition at Philadelphia, where we find
her studying the exhibits with the same thoroughness
she had shown in London and Cairo.
While she is on the wing, Mr. Carr writes to
her from Sedalia in June:</p>

<p>"I'm all right here, a little sick. Friday
night I lectured at Mexico. Brother Hardin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
and I took the freight to Moberly; and then
here, in time for the meeting. Dr. Hopson is
in the chair and there are twenty-nine preachers
present. I met Brother Longan last night,
and he laughed as we shook hands. He and I
will have a private dig. What do Brothers
Wilkes and Rogers think of his 'One Word
More' in the last <i>Christian</i>? Do they think
Longan is right on the ghost question? This
is a charming city. The country around looks
like the best part of Fayette County" (of
course he is speaking of Kentucky.)</p>

<p>"The little I have seen, is bewitching. I am
on for a speech tomorrow, and have been too
sick to prepare it, and here I sit with my finger
in my mouth! I hope I'll do as well as &mdash;&mdash; did
last night, and I think I will! Brother
Monser is my roommate, and we did talk last
night! I think he likes my wife better than he
does me. Well, I let him. He is a good man.
He spoke of the time Brother Mountjoy conducted
you to the platform at Mexico."</p>

<p>The following, from Fulton, Missouri, signed
by three citizens, shows that while at the
Exposition, Mrs. Carr was making plans for
future work: "In compliance with your request,
we report as follows,&mdash;We have interviewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
the members of the church in town, and
find them quite favorable towards patronizing
a school of our own; we think 30 or 40 may
certainly be counted upon at the opening. We
cannot do anything until we first ascertain
that we are going to have a school taught.
Desks, seats, etc., can be easily secured when
we find there is to be a necessity for them. If
preparations be commenced at once, we think a
very good school can be founded here."</p>

<p>September 7th, Mrs. Carr wrote to Mr. Carr
from Washington, D.C.: "I am writing in
the celebrated Washington Post Office. I have
learned a great deal during my short stay in
Washington. I have made a pilgrimage to the
American's Mecca,&mdash;but I boiled my peas,&mdash;and
have visited all the places of interest in the
city. I will reach St. Louis to-morrow afternoon.
Tell Sister Childers I would rather have
the room over the parlor, for you know how
wakeful I am. The room over her room we can
have for a study. May the Lord abundantly
bless my dear husband, and grant me the happiness
of seeing him once more face to face."</p>

<p>On the same day, Mr. Carr wrote to Mrs.
Carr: "Brother Franklin preaches at Fulton
to-day, so I have run down here to Louisiana,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Missouri, to try to get a pupil for you" (for the
prospective school, perhaps to be established at
Fulton.) "You say you will be in St. Louis
soon&mdash;then in Fulton, I suppose, about the
12th. Is it possible that I shall see my dear
wife so soon? I do long to see you and have
your encouragement, and enjoy your counsel,
your comfort and your love. You say, 'I have
just called on H. W. Longfellow. What a
grand old man he is! His poetic soul flows
through every word he utters. I wonder if he
<i>ever</i> did anything that was wrong?' I wish I
could have accomplished more in our St. Louis
work. I believe our new field at Fulton is
promising."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr's fourth experiment in the educational
world was at Fulton, where she established
Floral Hill College for girls. Her note
book shows that her rules of discipline were as
wise and as rigid, as if her attendance had been
much larger. The attendance was not indeed
large, but it was sufficient to place the institution
upon a paying basis.</p>

<p>At this time the Orphan School was at Camden
Point, and Floral Hill College had no rival
in Fulton. However, at Columbia, not far
away, Christian College proved a formidable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
check to any thought of future greatness.
Christian College had long been established;
it was handsomely equipped, and could make
the appeal throughout the State, that Floral
Hill College could not offer. Mrs. Carr found
herself at the head of a college whose management
depended solely upon her own wisdom;
but as an offset to this advantage, she knew
that her institution could never become a
mighty force in Missouri.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;I Want to Educate you&quot;&mdash;&quot;Absorbing Thoughtfulness.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The spring of 1877 saw the close of her first
year's work, and the following, written by Mr.
Carr, in August, shows that she intended to
open school in the fall; he writes from Maysville,
for he is on a visit among the scenes of
his youth:</p>

<p>"Mother and I went by Mill Creek, where
Brothers Jno. I. Rogers and I. B. Grubbs are
holding a meeting, on to Mt. Carmel. Thursday
I dined with Brothers Grubbs, Rogers,
Loos and Myall at Sister Mayhue's&mdash;she was
one of my schoolmates at May's Lick. The
meeting at Mill Creek closed last night with
several additions. Everybody asks why I
didn't bring you. Kate would 'give anything
to go to Floral Hill College'. Grandfather is
nearly 86 years of age, and has been very ill of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
late. I talked long with him, as he lay there,
and read 2 Cor. 5, and prayed with him. He
wept for joy and simply said 'I am waiting for
the Lord's will to be done.' I am so glad to
find father and mother able to go about.
They are still working for their children. You
must be encouraged about your school.
Brothers Grubbs and Rogers praise you for
your work. But nobody praises you more (I
mean <i>prizes</i>) than I!"<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>


<p>Mrs. Carr had not been teaching long on her
second year, when she received a request from
Mrs. P. F. Johnson, President of the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
Women's Board of Missions, to make an address
at the St. Louis convention, to be held
October 19, 1877. The subject given was,
'Children in Mission Work.' The request was
seconded by Mrs. Sarah Wallace, who made
this interesting comment:</p>

<p>"From the very beginning of our work as a
Society, we have had to battle with the habit
of 'giving nothing' among our churches. The
people are not stingy, but they do not realize
the necessity of systematic giving. When we
wanted to add to the amount for Brother
Darly's school (the mission school in Jamaica),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
it was asked, What can the children do?
Our board advanced the amount, then issued
an appeal to the Sunday-schools. We wanted
the children to have a work of their own.
Brother Darly's school proved more than a success,
passed the examination in six months, and
is now under the patronage of the Government.
As a result of the appeals, the Sunday-schools
gave, first quarter, $12; second quarter,
$23; third quarter, $36; fourth quarter,&mdash;not
yet reported. It is now decided that a
school be established at Kingston. It will call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
for about $250. The Board desires to continue
this as children's work. Mrs. Jameson feels
confident of meeting you in St. Louis, when
she will tell you the whole story. Her illness is
not violent, but lingering, as malignant fever
usually is."</p>

<p>In the meantime, O. A. Carr had been
preaching for the Fulton Church. The following
from Geo. W. Longan of Plattsburg, Mo.,
shows the activity of both, and that "private
digs" about ghosts had no place in public
work for the Cause:</p>

<p>"March 6, 1878: Of course, I can't consent
to take the burden on my shoulder! It
falls of right on yours, and you can carry it as
easily as any one. The objects of the convention
are to discuss themes of living interest, and
general utility as a sort of preachers' drill. We
aim to assign subjects according to the known
tastes of the individuals chosen. I suggest
that no one be selected who was on the program
last year. Of course, the country around
Fulton will furnish most of the speakers. The
subject, 'Phases of Current Unbelief' would be
both interesting and profitable in the hands of
the right man. I think J. Z. Taylor would
write a good paper on that, or A. F. Smith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
or President Geo. S. Bryant, of Columbia.
Procter had nothing last year; you might get
him to preach at night. Experience proves
that two papers with discussions following,
and a sermon at night, is the best division of
time. I will try to compel my mind to think
of other objects. Write to Edgar for suggestions
as to men."</p>

<p>(We may state parenthetically, that the
reason the present writer never again met Mrs.
Carr, though she often returned on visits to
St. Louis, is because Dr. Ellis moved from the
city, first to take charge of Woodland College
at Independence, later to assume the presidency
of Plattsburg College at Plattsburg, Mo.,
where Geo. W. Longan was still preaching.)</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr had not finished her second year
at Floral Hill College when a series of letters
were exchanged between her and the President
of Christian College at Columbia, Geo. S. Bryant.
These letters show a consciousness on
her part that Floral Hill College, if continued,
was destined to remain overshadowed by larger
institutions; and a conviction on his part
that Christian College must inevitably suffer
from the nearness of Floral Hill. President
Bryant seeks to absorb Mrs. Carr's institution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
and to employ Mrs. Carr as Associate Principal,&mdash;the
same relationship she had held toward
Robt. Graham at Hocker. This correspondence
is interesting, and throws light upon
Mrs. Carr's ability as a woman of business.
Not only does she gain the various points for
which she contends, such as the number of
hours she is to teach, the amount of salary she
is to receive, etc., but she is jealous of her official
position, and will have none of its privileges
abridged. President Bryant is a man who
loves his joke, and is inclined to illuminate contested
ground with the glow of good-fellowship;
but Mrs. Carr will have none of his humor until
all her propositions are definitely accepted.
At last, May 23, 1878, President Bryant
writes:</p>

<p>"The propositions of yours of the 21st&mdash;eight
in number&mdash;are the propositions of our
agreement, as I understand them. So Christian
College and Floral Hill College are one! I
congratulate Christian College upon the accomplishment
of so desirable an end. Please
allow me to say that your spirit of self-sacrifice
has not gone unnoticed. Instead of assigning
reasons to the 'Fulton Public,' would it not
be better,&mdash;'To the Public?'&mdash;For Floral Hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
College was not an institution of Fulton simply.
I will gladly publish in the catalogue a statement
over your own name, of the reasons."</p>

<p>This agreement was reached after months of
negotiations.</p>

<p>Floral Hill College was absorbed by Christian
College, accordingly; but Mrs. Carr's personality
was one that refused to be absorbed by
any association, or institution. So definite
were her ideas of the management of a school,
particularly in regard to its discipline, that her
position as associate principal could never have
been satisfactory in any school. Mrs. Carr
was a woman of intense conviction, and when
attempts were made to persuade her from her
principles, she felt that she was being persuaded
to error. Those who are by nature
fitted to lead, find their inborn talent curbed,
when this leadership is clogged. In any school,
there can be but one real head. Mrs. Carr
would not look upon her position as associate
principal as an honorary title; nor could she
feel that she was doing all she could for the
education of girls, when her ideas of education,
which emphasized conduct, clashed with those
of others who insisted rather upon grades in
recitation. As at Hocker in Lexington, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
now at Christian College in Columbia, she
grew restive before the year had expired.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1879, Mr. Carr again went
to Kentucky to hold meetings, and we find him
lingering among the scenes of his boyhood, and
naturally thinking much of the past.</p>

<p>"March 17. As I walked about the streets
at Mt. Carmel, many familiar objects met my
gaze. There was the road along which you
used to take your morning walks, and the
woods in which the birds sang for you their
best early songs. They put me to sleep in the
parlor where you said to me, '<i>I will go with
you!</i>'&mdash;that room in which I first became acquainted
with you, and asked you to go on an
excursion with me to sculapia. I thought of
the past and tried to sketch the future, and
prayed that you may be happily situated. I
expect to have a happy meeting at Carmel,
for those old familiar faces inspire me. If you
were here, I could preach much better.</p>

<p>"March 20, Stony Point. This is my sister's
home, midway between Paris and Winchester"
(the sister Minnie, now Mrs. John
Fox, Sr., whom we heard of in the May's Lick
days). "I am sitting at the old desk where,
seventeen years ago, I conned my Greek grammar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
under the instruction of my brother-in-law
Jno. W. Fox, who is the head of this
house, and the head of a school here, of
eighteen years' standing. He has a family of
ten children all of whom, except the infant,
have been taught by him. One son, Johnnie,
passed the Harvard examination last spring,
and is now at Lexington. Professor Neville
brags on him, and says he knocks '95' every
time in his Greek class. His half-brother Jimmie,
is one of the public school principals of
Lexington, and is much respected there. He
has taken Johnnie with him, pays his board
and tuition, and assists him in his studies."
(The reader will doubtless recognize in "Johnnie",
the author of "Little Shepherd of Kingdom
Come," and "Trail of the Lonesome
Pine.") "President Graham was out here, and
stayed one night. He enjoyed it! He says, in
talking of us, 'Ollie and Mattie.' The children
all fell in love with him, and gave him cakes.
My father is able to walk, and my mother's
general health is good. At Lexington, I saw
many of your old friends: Grubbs, Cox, etc.
Doctor Hopson and Brother Graham say that
you ought to take a good rest. <i>Now do you
hear?</i> That is from headquarters! My visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
at Lexington was too short. I fell in with
some Australian students who came near
monopolizing my time. One young man, Charlie
Thurgood, used to work in a baker's shop
all week, and come to my house in Melburne,
Saturday nights, to learn grammar. Now he
is in Lexington, preparing to preach the Word.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
The Bible College has 45 students, College of
Arts 65, Agricultural and Mechanical 105.
Professor Neville says it is the most pleasant
session he ever had. Hamilton College" (formerly
Hocker College) "has moderate success. I
gave them a Bible reading at Broadway
Church, Wednesday evening. The audience
was very good. It was like old times."</p>

<p>When her first year's work ended at Christian
College, Mrs. Carr, though dissatisfied
with the restraints upon her, had not decided
to relinquish her position as associate principal.
However, she and President Bryant were unable
to agree upon terms, and in July she
definitely terminated her engagement. "I
would not insult President Bryant," she wrote
him, "by supposing for a moment that he expected
Mrs. Carr to accept the propositions in
his last letter."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>
<p>She observes that she would have considered
a re-engagement because of Mr. Carr's earnest
desire to assist L. B. Wilkes, then in poor
health at Columbia, and also because Mrs.
Carr's work in the College had been greatly appreciated
by patrons. But the curtailment of
her privileges and authority, is intolerable; the
matter of salary is of no moment, in view of
this obstacle; nor will she hesitate to make the
matter clear to all who seek enlightenment. As
she remarks, "I do not know exactly what you
mean by burying the past. In the course of
the sad work, you may cast a few clods over
the remains of Mrs. Carr's once prosperous
school. If by burying the past, you mean,
stop all discussion of our differences, I have
only to say, it is impossible to bury that which
is not dead. Be assured, I would not bury it
alive if I could. When I am asked why I do
not remain at Christian College, I am constrained
to tell the whole truth, though I would
rather be silent." Let us hope that President
Bryant's sense of humor enabled him to enjoy
this keen sarcasm.</p>

<p>About this time, Dr. S. S. Laws, President
of the University of the State of Missouri, situated
at Columbia, became desirous of associating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
Mrs. Carr with the University. He
had been deeply impressed not only by her
scholarship and wide experience, but by her
reputation as a disciplinarian. As she was now
free from Christian College, he expressed to her
his hope that she would consider an offer.
Such an association could not but be looked
upon by her as a high promotion in her beloved
calling.</p>

<p>September 1, 1879, Dr. Laws wrote to Mrs.
Carr as follows: "I mentioned the case to our
Local Board, and their favorable action I now
send you. Your answer will, of course, be addressed
to the Board, but I'd be obliged for a
note by bearer, informing me of your acceptance&mdash;I
should say, of your <i>answer</i>, as I will
then be able to leave on the evening train for
St. Louis."</p>

<p>With this note, the present chapter properly
terminates; it has been a chapter of changes,
of rapid transitions. We have now reached a
period of stability, of advancement, of growth,&mdash;the
ten years of Mrs. Carr's connection with
the University of Missouri.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>LADY PRINCIPAL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
MISSOURI.</h3>


<p>During the ten years of Mrs. Carr's
connection with the University of
Missouri, we find her busy mind occupied
by three entirely distinct sets
of interests.</p>

<p>In the first place, of course, there was the
University work, into which she threw herself
with tireless energy and splendid success. The
position she occupied was Professor of English,
and Dean of the Young Ladies' Department,&mdash;a
two-fold work, which threw her into contact
with both sexes in the classroom, and called for
the exercise of rapid judgment in the government
of the young ladies.</p>

<p>As Lady Principal, she not only preserved
order in the study, looked after the health of
its occupants, shaped the literary exercises of
the various organizations, and gave as much
energy to procuring new students as if she were
conducting a private school; but she strove to
win the confidence of her girls, that she might
lead them to higher spiritual planes of life; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
we find her making the same religious impress
upon the minds of the young men.</p>

<p>We need but refer to two letters written to
Mrs. Carr in later years, leaving the reader to
judge of the positive results of such a character
as that of Mrs. Carr; results too significant
and lasting, to excuse a lack of appreciation, or
to palliate the breach of unkind criticism. One
is written by a distinguished citizen who states
that he was on the eve of committing suicide,
when he came under Mrs. Carr's influence; and
that she, unconscious of his darkened mind,
saved him by the clear radiance of her daily
life. The other tells of a young man who entered
the University with no ambitions and
no purposes in life.</p>

<p>"All that I am now," he writes, "I owe to
the time spent with you in the classroom." He
occupies a high government position.</p>

<p>In 1882, Mrs. Carr, writing to Hon. J. S.
Rollins, states what she regards as her most
important duties at the University: "The subject
of my salary was thoroughly discussed last
year by your Executive Committee, and it was
reported to me by Eld. J. K. Rogers, that my
salary of $1,500 should remain unchanged.
The avenue to my highest success in my supervisory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
work (which is indeed, my chief work), is
my social intercourse with the young ladies under
my charge; and this can be best secured by
having a home in which I am free to invite
them at any time. My classroom work, as
Adjunct in the English Department, and as
teacher of calisthenics, entitles me to $1,200,
and the classwork is the least important, and
the least embarrassing, of all. My supervisory
work demands the most constant and harassing
thought and involves great responsibility."</p>

<p>The following from Mrs. Carr, to the Board
of Curators, will show how thoroughly she
threw herself into the interests of her young
friends: "I hereby testify that the appropriation
asked by the Philalethian Society, is needed
to complete the furnishing of their Hall. I
need not tell you that the work for girls in our
University is yet in its infancy, and needs
especially, therefore, your guardianship and
helping hand. I have encouraged the young
ladies to appeal to you, through President
Laws. If you hesitate to grant the petition
on the grounds of financial pressure, will you
please allow $138.60 of my salary to be deferred,
until after the next appropriation by our Legislature?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Carr began to lay great stress upon the
physical developments of her pupils,&mdash;a neglected
branch of education in her own case. Her
entire work at the University was destined to
strengthen those powers of government,
already highly developed, for the future scene
of her greatest usefulness; and, in after years,
we find her views on physical culture, carried
out in concrete form. In addressing the young
ladies of the University, she said:</p>

<p>"If you will stand for one day at the corner
of Washington Avenue and 4th Street, St.
Louis, or Broadway and Fulton, New York,
and watch the passing multitude, you will see
scarcely one in ten who is erect, or well-built.
The large majority of Americans are born of
imperfectly developed parents. After six years'
association with the robust women of England
and the Continent, the physical degeneracy of
American women appeared more marked to me
than ever before. In London, the broad feet
of robust women make the flags resound in the
early morning; in New York, the tiny feet of
pale-faced ladies trip along Broadway at stated
fashionable hours. An Englishwoman thinks
nothing of walking from six to ten miles a day.
After climbing and descending the Cheops of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Egypt, I was unable for three days to ascend
an easy flight of stairs. An Englishwoman
who went up the Cheops as I did, rowed up
the Nile, the following day, to the Boolak
Museum, enjoyed a donkey ride back to Cairo,
returned to the hotel, and spent the evening in
nursing my aches and pains. Physical tendencies,
whether toward beauty or deformity,
like gentle dispositions and moral obliquities,
are inherited; remember that you are the coming
mothers of the nation."</p>

<p>It is not our intention to dwell upon Mrs.
Carr's daily life in Columbia. Any young lady
desiring to attend the University, is asked to
correspond with her. She delivers lectures in
the University Chapel; she contributes to the
Missouri University Magazine; she corresponds
with Miss A. M. Longfellow, daughter of the
poet, concerning their work&mdash;for Miss Longfellow
holds at this time, practically the same
position at Harvard, that Mrs. Carr does at
Columbia; she advises with Representatives
concerning the passage of bills at Jefferson City;
she is in frequent consultation with Dr. Laws
regarding the perplexing problems that are
always arising in University life.</p>

<p>In presenting the portrait of Dr. Laws to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
the young ladies of the Philalethian Society, in
1886, she compares the ladies department with
its status ten years before&mdash;the year before Dr.
Laws became president. It was natural for
her to attribute the secret of the great development
to the doctor's labors. Whatever may
have caused the wonderful growth, there can
be no doubt that much of it was due to Mrs.
Carr. She says: "In the catalogue of 1876,
all announcements concerning the young ladies
are restricted to 33 lines. It records 39 lady
students, only four of whom lived outside of
Boone County. The catalogue of 1885 records
a special service for young ladies; generous provisions
for their physical education; a Girls
Academic Course, equivalent in honor to any
other academic course of the University; a neatly
furnished and convenient study, on the first
floor, and another in our elegant library room;
a handsomely furnished society hall, lighted by
electricity; and many other conveniences, and
luxuries. We have 73 young ladies now attending
the University. They represent 28
counties of Missouri, and four states. In 1875,
no girl took a degree. In 1885, four received
academic degrees, four, professional degrees,
and one read the McAnally English Prize Essay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
On Commencement, 1886, one read the
Astronomical Prize Thesis, and another delivered
the valedictory of the Normal graduates."</p>

<p>A large and interesting volume could be filled
with the lectures of Mrs. Carr. For biographical
purposes, they need be simply referred to, as
an indication of one form of her activity. The
preparation of such discourses, replete with
classical and historical illustrations, must have
consumed many of these late hours snatched
from the rightful claims of repose and relaxation.
One might suppose that this woman,
always frail, always wakeful, liable at any time
to fall the victim to headache, would have found
the University work with its many-sided life,
much too great for her strength. For her
physical strength, it was, no doubt; but that
untiring mind found leisure, after its thousand
details, to turn in another direction. As we
have said, she had three separate sets of interests,
during the ten years at the University.
We are now to consider the second&mdash;her connection
with the women's missionary work of
her church.</p>

<p>We have a threefold purpose in dealing with
Mrs. Carr's work for the Christian Woman's
Board of Missions. In the first place, it formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
a large part in her life; in the second, the
work in itself is interesting; and in the third, it
proves how erroneous were the circulated reports
that Mrs. Carr was opposed to organized
missionary work. Concerning these reports
we shall speak at another time. At present
our difficulty is to select from among the many
appeals to Mrs. Carr to speak at conventions;
from reports of her addresses; from accounts
of money sent in by her for the missionary
magazine&mdash;the <i>Tidings</i>; and from the various
conferences held by her with the members of
the board,&mdash;lest our narrative be overburdened
with a mass of similar instances. It
seems almost incredible that one so absorbed
as she in the University work, could have given
not only her vacations, but special days during
the school year, to the labor of organization,
and platform addresses, appeals for money to
the missionary cause, and for subscribers to
the <i>Tidings</i>.</p>

<p>That strangers to the Christian Woman's
Board of Missions may understand just what
it was, and that its friends may know how
much it had accomplished at this time, we present
a condensed account of the organization,
delivered by Mrs. Carr at the Annual Convention,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
at Carthage, Mo., in 1885; by this means
we are not only enabled to introduce the subject,
but to give an adequate conception of Mrs.
Carr as a public speaker:</p>

<p>"I want to talk to you directly about our
mission work, giving a historical sketch of the
Christian Woman's Board of Missions from its
incipiency to the present time.</p>

<p>"In July, 1874, Mrs. Cornelia Neville Pearre
suggested the desirability of effecting a missionary
organization among the ladies of the
Christian Church. The sisters were exhorted to
consecrate monthly little sums of money from
their allowances, or salaries, as individual means
to the spread of the Gospel. The idea at once
became popular. A little Aid Society in Indianapolis
seized upon the thought, and discussed
it. At their meeting a stirring letter
was read from Mrs. Pearre setting forth the
purposes and basis of the proposed society.
At the same meeting, a brief article of incorporation
was drawn up, to which eight names
were signed. A president, secretary and treasurer
were elected, and a meeting appointed.</p>

<p>"The women composing the new society
were inexperienced in the work. Not one of
them had ever lifted her voice in a convention;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
all of them were wholly unskilled in parliamentary
address. They were simply housekeepers,
wives and mothers; but their hearts burned to
do more for the Master, and they had the rare
sense to know that organized effort is the
surest and shortest road to success. Not long
after, Brother Isaac Errett espoused their
cause, and sounded forth the entreaty, 'Help
these women!'</p>

<p>"This led to a mass meeting of Christian
women, held in Cincinnati at the same time as
the General Convention of the Christian
church. About seventy-five composed the
meeting, over which Mrs. Pearre presided; in a
most earnest and prayerful manner, she presented
the purposes and plans; and then and
there, the Christian Woman's Board of Missions
assumed an organized form, and entered
quietly upon its humble yet glorious career.</p>

<p>"Indianapolis was made headquarters for the
general officers. Five States were represented,
and a vice president, a secretary and managers,
were elected for each. After a full and free
discussion it was resolved that Jamaica should
be the first object of their care. The unanimous
vote for the revival of the Jamaica Mission,
which Brother Beardsley had been forced, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
sorrow, to abandon, and whose resumption
had long been postponed, brought delight to
many hearts; though some present had hoped
that a field nearer home would be chosen.</p>

<p>"The following December the Executive
Committee held its first meeting at Indianapolis,
and determined to make an effort to
establish Auxiliary Societies in every State and
Territory of the Union. The following January
$1,500 was in the treasury, and Brother
W. H. Williams of Platte City, Missouri, sailed
with his wife and child, for Jamaica.</p>

<p>"The day after his arrival in Kingston,
though debilitated from the rough voyage, he
preached to about thirty, in a dilapidated
Chapel. His audiences increased. He established
prayer meetings, Sunday-schools, teachers'
meetings, and carried the Gospel from
house to house. Through his instruction, several
native young men were soon prepared to
render valuable assistance. When, in 1879,
Brother Williams was forced to resign on account
of his wife's ill-health, he was succeeded
by Brother Isaac Tomlinson, under whom the
work steadily advanced.</p>

<p>"In 1882, Brother W. K. Azbill was appointed.
Through his association with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
Baptist ministers, he soon ascertained that the
differences between their doctrine and his was
merely nominal. His proposal that the name
'Christian' be substituted for 'Baptist' was
joyfully accepted by several of the oldest and
most intelligent ministers, who, with their entire
congregations, planted themselves upon the
Bible, and the Bible alone. A building-fund
was established looking toward the permanent
establishment of the work in Jamaica.</p>

<p>"We are especially anxious to put our schools
upon permanent basis, for the educational
work is, after all, the best and most lasting
missionary work. It is our earnest prayer that
we may see, after a few more patient years, the
desire of our heart fulfilled,&mdash;the cause of
Jamaica, the oldest born of our love, self-supporting,
under the exclusive management of
native talent.</p>

<p>"Brother and Sister DeLauney have, for
several years, been supported by the Foreign
Christian Missionary Society, at Paris, France.
In the summer of 1879, the Christian Woman's
Board of Missions, with hearts stirred by their
success in Jamaica, determined to contribute to
the French mission. At the Bloomington convention
they pledged $500 to the salary of Sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
DeLauney's assistant. Immediately after
this, our beloved Brother Timothy Coop of
England, without any knowledge of our purpose,
presented us with 100. God put it
into our hearts to promise $500, and He put it
into Brother Coop's heart to pay it, so that the
following year we were able to give $500 more
to the French mission.</p>

<p>"In 1881 we enlarged our mission by establishing
a mission among the freedmen of the
South. At Jacksonville, Mississippi, Elder R.
Faurot is carrying forward the evangelical and
educational work, among a large colored population.</p>

<p>"In 1882 the Christian Woman's Board of
Missions became a happy stockholder in the
India Mission. The Foreign Christian Missionary
Society sent Brother Albert Norton
and Brother G. L. Wharton and their wives;
we sent Miss Mary Greybiel, Miss Ada Boyd,
Miss Laura Kinsey and Miss Mary Kingsbury.
These offered themselves for that remote corner
of the Lord's vineyard, without any stipulated
salary. There is a work there which only
women can do. In Oriental countries, the
home must first be captured for Christ; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
in these homes, men cannot give instruction to
the hedged-in women.</p>

<p>"Missouri had the honor to suggest the
next field to be occupied&mdash;the far West. In
June, 1883, Brother J. Z. Taylor assumed control
of this department, and in a short time
Brother M. L. Streator was established at
Helena, and Brother Galen Hood at Deer
Lodge. These two congregations were at that
time the only ones in Montana. The Western
field is immense, and the sooner it is occupied,
the less the difficulty of occupation.</p>

<p>"As I spent six years of my life 10,000 miles
from home, helping my husband in his labors
for the Master, I will not be thought sectional
or narrow, though I say that I regard the
Western mission as our most important one.
Indifferentism, skepticism, Mormonism, and
almost the whole catalogue of <i>isms</i> are growing
rank in the busy, rushing, money-loving
Western heart; if the children of God do not
eradicate these poisonous weeds, American civilization
must inevitably deteriorate, for the
character of a country's civilization depends
upon the character of its people.</p>

<p>"In the midst of infidelity at home and heathenism
abroad, the Christian Woman's Board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
of Missions is pushing forward, in a quiet,
womanly way, without the sound of trumpets,
or the gleam of arms, its blessed work for the
Master. We are doing something; but a completer
organization will help us to a completer
work. The best results can be accomplished
only by a systematic plan, a comprehensive
grasp and a disposition of forces: We must
organize ever new auxiliaries; we must
strengthen the weaklings, revive the dying,
and, by the power of the living Christ, bring
the dead from their graves of idleness. Let us
have more and better societies. The gifted
Mrs. Browning says:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The world wails</span>
<span class="i0">For help, beloved. Let us love so well,</span>
<span class="i0">Our work shall be the better for our love.</span>
<span class="i0">And still our love be sweeter for our work.'</span>
</div>

<p>"Daily, we pass into the likeness of that
which we believe. Very soon, Faith hangs out
a label, and the whole woman becomes a confession
of its truth. If you have faith in God
to save souls, you will certainly be transformed
into the perfect likeness of the missionary
woman. You may have much to discourage
you; it may be better for you, if you do.
Those from whom you have the best right to
expect sympathy, may be those who will misinterpret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
the truest purposes of your heart.
He who engages in any work worth the doing,
must antagonize somebody. But what of
that? Is not woman the best burden-bearer?
Can you not weep tears of bitterness,&mdash;yet
press on, in the midst of all discouragements,
to the beautiful likeness of the Great Missionary,
who left the solemn injunction, 'Go ye
into all the world, and preach the Gospel to
every creature?'</p>

<p>"We scatter the seed. But when we are old
and feeble, who will gather in the golden
sheaves? Where are the future reapers and
sowers? They are in the Children's Bands.
In them you will find the sure prophecy of the
future of the Christian Woman's Board of
Missions. Whether that prophesy be radiant
with promise, depends upon how we are educating
the girls of to-day, to be the women of
tomorrow. Some time, our brains will grow
dull, our hands helpless. Shall not the daughters
receive the torch of truth from the hands
of the mothers?</p>

<p>"In conclusion, let it be felt as inevitable that
we should often feel tired by the way; that we
should hunger for human sympathy; that our
best efforts at times prove barren of results,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
through the indifference of God's children; that
the purest purposes of our hearts be impugned
by those we love best; for a public work, however
unobtrusively performed, and painful criticism,
cannot be divorced. It is said that there
is a grape which, transplanted from its native
soil, loses its taste; but possesses the flavor of
the soil, when grown upon the banks of the
Rhine. It is only when our lives are planted in
the aromatic soil of the love of humanity, that
our lives shall be identified by the richness of
Christianity; and no human hand, however unkindly
strong, shall be able to transplant our
affections into an alien soil, or take from our
lives their flavor of piety and devotion."</p>

<p>Having now placed before the reader the object
and accomplishments of the Christian
Woman's Board of Missions, in Mrs. Carr's
own words, thus showing her attitude toward
it, we come to speak of the third great purpose
that influenced her life during the ten years'
work at the University.</p>

<p>It was none other than the same central idea
of her life which we found developed in the
Daughters College days of her girlhood. She
realized that in her present position at Columbia,
she had reached the highest step in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
educational career; the highest, because she was
thrown into touch with the greatest number
of young lives which it became her privilege to
shape toward lofty aims.</p>

<p>Indeed, her entire history shows advance
steps. The tentative experiment of her first
school at Lancaster was fortunately relinquished
for her work among the girls of Australia,
with its broadening experiences. Having
acquired that broader view of life that
comes with the extended horizon of foreign
lands, it would have been unfortunate, had she
not returned to America to communicate the
fruits of her observations. Hocker College was,
accordingly, an advance upon the Melbourne
work, just as Floral Hill, where she was sole
authority, hence better able to carry out her
original ideas,&mdash;was an advance upon Hocker.
Her keen foresight, and unalterable determination
to sacrifice personal feelings for the development
of wider aims, led her to merge Floral
Hill into Christian College, thus losing her
identity in swelling the general good. As we
have seen, the promotion from the Christian
College to the State University was one of far-reaching
importance.</p>

<p>And yet, Mrs. Carr was not content. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
had not reached that ideal toward which she
had directed her gaze when a mere girl; and,
in the elements of her nature, there were traits
that refused to be satisfied by anything but the
great object in view. Success did not for an
hour swerve her aside from her fundamental
purpose; to establish a college for girls in
which she might develop her original ideas of
government and tuition.</p>

<p>Hence, all during the Columbia days, we find
her seeking a promising opening. Her eyes were
turned toward many fields. Her caution and
prudence prevented her from relinquishing a
great responsibility for an uncertain experiment;
but her indefatigable mind, while rejecting one
expedient after another, never wearied in the
quest. Hence it is that during those years, we
find her absorbed not only in University work,
not only in missionary interests, but always, as
well, in the great object of her life.</p>

<p>It was particularly in the latter that her
husband proved of invaluable assistance. Called
to preach in many diverse scenes, it was his
pleasure, and his care, to look about for a suitable
opening where a college for girls might be
established; a college whose foundation stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
should be the Word of God, and whose every
day's instruction should be permeated with the
love and power of its truth.</p>

<h3>PURSUING ONE'S IDEAL.</h3>


<p>The letters presented in the present
chapter are not only interesting in
themselves, but are valuable as illustrating
the threefold bent of Mrs.
Carr's mind, as outlined in the preceding
pages. They cover her University experiences.
Here is a manuscript revealing Mrs.
Carr's struggles with the Greek language.
She has evidently just taken up this study;
her exercises show the same thoroughness she
exhibited in her German commonplace-book.</p>

<p>Here is a receipt from the Christian Woman's
Board of Missions for $50 which Mrs. Carr
has sent on subscriptions to the <i>Tidings</i>.
And Mrs. S. F. D. Eastin writes from St.
Joseph, 1880, requesting Mrs. Carr to read
her essay before the Moberly convention. "I
know it will be worthy the attention of that
erudite body," says Mrs. Eastin. Worthy
<i>any</i> erudite body it should have been; the subject
is "John Stuart Mill and C. W. B. M."</p>

<p>Mr. Carr to Mrs. Carr, October 23, 1880,
from the Louisville convention: "Your letter
was handed me in church just before Brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
McGarvey's excellent address. Your words
rang through my soul all the time he was
preaching. The devotion to the Cause expressed
in your letter is an echo of my heart,
and I second your motion to go to Paris next
summer, but I fear you will exhaust yourself in
such abundant labors. Your spirit is too
strong, and too active, for your body. I gave
Sister Eastin your message and she says it is
the very thing. This has been a glorious convention,
most orderly and deeply pious. I
delivered to the convention the messages of
Brother and Sister Rogers and Brother and
Sister Wilkes. To-day the convention closed
in tears and in high hopes, for the future.
Brother Magarey" (our "Alex." of Melbourne
association) "went to Bethany yesterday. He
looks a little older, but is the same blessed man.
I love him. We had long talks. Brother
Gore will visit home before long. All well at
Brother Santo's. I got this sheet of paper
from Jimmie Fox's desk. He is doing well&mdash;Adjunct
Professor in the Male High School. I
am writing at the office of the <i>Old Path Guide</i>.
Brothers Hardin, Allen, Cline, et al., are talking
all around me. Hardin goes to St. Louis tonight;
I send this by him, that you may get it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
soon. Collis and Thurgood asked of you
especially. I told Brother McGarvey of your
work, of Brother Wilkes' estimation of you, of
your position in the University, of the high
praise President Laws gives you, etc., and
Brother McGarvey says he wishes you could
have a work directly in the interests of Christianity;
but all he can advise is, to stay in the
University until such a position opens up."</p>

<p>W. W. Dowling to Mr. and Mrs. Carr: "I
am publishing in the <i>Sunday School Teacher</i>,
biographical sketches of some of our prominent
Sunday-school workers. I want a sketch of
both of you&mdash;a synopsis of your lives and
labors."</p>

<p>J. W. McGarvey to Mr. Carr, June 30, 1883:
"I am glad you have the heart and ability to
care for your aged parents as you do. In regard
to educational affairs, I doubt the possibility
of legally removing the Canton Institution.
If you need an institution for the education
of preachers, you cannot do better than to
build a house, and endow two chairs in connection
with the University. But I do not see
that you need it for many years to come. Our
College at Lexington can receive all your young
men, and do a better part by them, at less expense.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
An attempt to have a Bible College in
every State where we have a strong membership,
will result in a large number of weaklings.
The Baptists in all the South aim at but one;
the Presbyterians, the same. We are now aiming
at six or seven, and ours, the largest, has
only 94. Since Geo. Bryant has gone home, I
hear they are expecting 250 guests at Independence.
I am surprised so many are expected.
I have not heard whether Brother
Oldham made a good reputation at first, or
not. I am sure, however, that he will establish
a reputation and secure success. I hope the
preachers will help him." (Oldham was Bryant's
successor at Christian College, Columbia.
The institution referred to, at Independence,
was Woodland College.)</p>

<p>November 4, 1883, O. A. Carr issued a circular
addressed to the Alumn of Christian
College, urging them to send matter for the
forthcoming book, "Biography of President
J. K. Rogers, and History of Christian College."
This was a book Mr. Carr had undertaken
at the request of President Rogers's
widow. The work was attended with much
difficulty and many delays, on account of the
alumn pursuing the usual course of alumn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
by refusing, as a whole, to answer request or
entreaty.</p>

<p>Mrs. S. E. Shortridge, from Indianapolis, to
Mrs. Carr, February 20: "I have been working
all day steadily on the <i>Tidings</i>, and tonight,
being too nervous to sleep, I take advantage
of this halt to write to you, though the
midnight hour is not far away." (Mrs. Shortridge
was the Cor. Sec. of the C. W. B. M.)
"Accept my thanks for the kindness and
patience with which you have gone over the
whole ground. I quite agree with you in the
main; the only difference between us is, I believe,
in the exceptions to the rule. I must assure
you that we are of one mind here at Indianapolis.
Perfect harmony and confidence
prevail. This is particularly true of Sister
Jameson and myself." (Mrs. Jameson was the
president of the C. W. B. M.)</p>

<p>"From her I have no secret. We are very
near neighbors; I see her almost daily; yet I am
continually finding new beauties of character
to love and admire. I find the <i>Tidings</i> cannot
be enlarged this year: I wish it could." (At
this time the <i>Tidings</i> was a small four-page
sheet, four columns to the page.) "We are not
able to rent a room, or office, and we work at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
great disadvantage. I never look at the paper
that my conscience does not stir uneasily, it reminds
me so much of a motherless child. And
yet&mdash;I am doing the best I can. I have no
journalistic genius, Mrs. Goodwin always insisted
that I had, but she was blinded by love.
If I have talent, it is still dormant. I do believe
in you, and trust you fully, my dear Sister
Carr. I think of you as a lovely Christian woman,
incapable of consciously doing an unjust
thing."</p>

<p>L. B. Wilkes, from Stockton, Cal., to
Mrs. Carr: "I am better&mdash;nearly well. Still,
if you were here to rub my head, I believe it
would hurt me pretty often yet. You are in
earnest&mdash;you would like to come to California&mdash;and
will, if I can find a place for you and the
doctor" (meaning Mr. Carr, of course.) "The
school business is overdone among our folks.
We have three colleges, all mixed schools, and
pretty badly mixed. Just come to our house
and stay till you find a place, let that be long
or short. I don't know how to write a letter,
so leave the gossipy part to my wife, she is good
at it. I will start the doctor a paper in which
I have a small piece on the organ." (For in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
those days one could write about the organ,
when all other subjects failed.)</p>

<p>To which letter, Mrs. Wilkes adds a postscript&mdash;"He
says I am good at gossip; I deny
the charge. He would have you both come on
here; but selfish as I am, I cannot insist on
your coming, for fear you might not like the
place."</p>

<p>In 1884 O. A. Carr was appointed State
Evangelist for Missouri, and the following
notes are taken from his letters to Mrs. Carr.
The names of places are generally omitted:</p>

<p>"March 3. We are poorly represented here.
The people don't seem to believe the Bible.
A woman, though, has been taking the rag
off the bush. It is said she can out preach a
man&mdash;goodness! my wife could beat nine-tenths
of the preachers, but I'm glad she's a
woman who wouldn't preach publicly before a
promiscuous audience. There is a gloomy
prospect here. Ignorance&mdash;you never saw the
like. At Trenton I tried to raise money to
seat the meeting house at &mdash;&mdash;, but they
said, 'That is in the midst of a good agricultural
district&mdash;why don't they build their own
church?' They don't know that infidelity
stalks abroad in daylight there, and that infidelity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
does not build meeting houses or anything
else that is good. I have been talking
to an old brother with his wife&mdash;mine host&mdash;on
missionary work, trying to show that I am in
as legitimate a business as the editor of the
<i>Review</i> when he publishes a paper. The
woman yielded at last&mdash;said at least there is no
harm in it. Good! My desire is to meet
some more of such people, and convert
them. I believe I can do it! I will have a
heft at it here, I think. Some good old men
have tried to preach and farm, and have not
done either very well, I presume. It will be
difficult to persuade these people to give $200
for once-a-month preaching, when they have
been giving about five dollars. I have not
done a thing on the Biography of President
Rogers, nor do I see how I can at this rate. I
have a bad cold. The door is warped and
won't close, and last night the wind whipped
around into the bed, and everywhere. I've got
the stove between me and that crack in the
door now, and some of the atmosphere will
have to get warmed, before it reaches me.
Brother A. B. Jones says I'd better stay at
&mdash;&mdash; and work it up; but there's nothing
to work up, and the only chance I see is to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
that place joined on to the congregation here.</p>

<p>"March 6. I've tried to introduce the envelope
system of contribution in the church
here (Gallatin) and have run myself down today;
from house to house. I am in a cold
room, writing after speaking tonight at the
Christian convention. I enclose $25 for you to
forward to father, Wm. Carr, Maysville, Ky.
Brother S. P. Richardson says, 'Give my love
to Mrs. Carr.' He says he was in your class
at the University, and thinks a great deal of
you. He says he had a good time in your
class. He was a law student. Will Sister
Rogers be satisfied with delay of the Biography
till fall? How I do wish I had the material for
a complete biography. I don't like to blame
anybody, but I have tried faithfully to collect it.
I do not like to think of anything incomplete
in connection with that grand, good man.</p>

<p>"March 9. Thank you for that nice letter;
there was great encouragement in it. A vision
of you comes before me&mdash;it is a charming picture.
You say you are anxious that I should
succeed. But in my case, what is success? If
adding members to the churches is a success, I
have failed already. I have been setting
churches in order, and teaching the brethren.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
Here at Gallatin, we meet in a hall. There is
no house, and the members are poor. From
Trenton I go to Breckenridge, or Grant City.
Brother Floyd of the <i>Christian Herald</i>, of
Oregon asks me for a Missouri sub-editor. I
have recommended you to him. I have written
my notes for the <i>Christian Standard</i> and
<i>Christian-Evangelist</i>. I will watch for your
article and see if it sounds like I wrote it.
That was a big joke! Did <i>I</i> know what you
could say about John Stuart Mill and the C.
W. B. M.? I don't suppose Mill ever heard of
such a thing as the C. W. B. M., and I don't
know how you thought of both names at once.
I wish you would write a dozen articles for our
church papers&mdash;divide them around. Write on
Women's Work, for the <i>Quarterly</i>.</p>

<p>"April 15. I rode twelve miles horseback for
your letter, which heightened the joy of receiving
it. I am utterly discouraged about that
Biography of Brother Rogers. I cannot find
time and quiet to write. For instance, I
walked nearly two miles to church, then two
more to reach a place to stay all night&mdash;where
I had to sit up, and be sociable till I was worn
out. The people are generous here, and I
think, religious. The church is ajar, and I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
expected to set it in order. It is rather discouraging
for me to have to do the hard work,
then leave to set another church in order, while
some one else follows me up, and holds the
meetings and gets the additions. I am here,
trying to get the members to act decently toward
one another. It will take a week to warm
them up, and then I will have to leave.</p>

<p>"April 19. It rained so much last night, I
could not get to meeting, and I am compelled
to stay in doors. Mine host is a good man.
He and wife and six children are all crowded
together in two rooms, and we have confusion
worse confounded. I have to cross a swampy
valley to and from church (distance two miles)
and a muddy, snaky river that is to be despised.
Our toilette arrangements consists of a washpan
outside the house. It will take a week to
get the Christians to be friends with each
other. I heat up in church and cool off walking
home, and cough at night. Between
coughs, I think of you, wondering if you are
wearing yourself out with toil and anxiety.
Learn to take life more leisurely! My idea is
for you to become author&mdash;write a book or two,
if you please, and contribute to the journals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
Our papers need your talent. Please forward
the enclosed $25 to mother."</p>

<p>From J. W. McGarvey, Lexington, Kentucky,
to Mrs. Carr, April 29, '84: "Brother
Patterson is to continue at Hamilton College at
least one more year. He is making money out
of the school at a very handsome rate; but the
fact that he is building a fine dwelling on the
place he bought from Brother Lard's estate,
indicates that he will not remain much longer
than a year. When the time comes, you may
rest assured that I will present your claims and
merits before the Board, in all their attractiveness.
I have no doubt you could make a
success of it. I am sorry I cannot accept
Brother J. A. Lord's invitation to lecture on
'Bible Colleges' at Columbia."</p>

<p>The following of July 15th, shows Mrs. Carr
working in a fresh field&mdash;the Women's Christian
Temperance Union: "As Corresponding
Secretary of the Columbia Union, I send you
the following resolutions, which were unanimously
adopted at the last session of the Union:
* * * Be it resolved that we as an individual
Union protest against the resolution
passed at the Sedalia Convention, namely,
'That the White Ribbon hosts of Missouri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
work for woman suffrage.' The woman suffrage
attachment will necessarily complicate the
nature of our plea. An organization already
exists entitled, 'The Woman Suffrage Association',
whose exclusive purpose is woman's suffrage.
Many of our friends, and many in our
own ranks, oppose the plea of woman's suffrage,
as a part of our plea for temperance."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr writes to Mr. Carr concerning a
church quarrel which he is striving to quell&mdash;judging
from her letter his efforts at warming
up the members has taken an unfortunate
direction. The letter is interesting as showing
Mrs. Carr's wisdom in such delicate affairs: "I
cannot tell you how deeply I deplore this
church difficulty. Deal with the matter very
gently. Don't write sharply to any one, for if
you do, you will be misrepresenting yourself,
and injure the work. Let the matter readjust
itself. I advise you to so arrange your work as
not to be present at the county meeting. Your
presence at this juncture might do harm to
you and to the Cause. Stay away, and write
them a good, fatherly letter, to be read before
the convention. I'm sure, intuitively, that this
will be best. Your success is the burden of
my prayers. After a few more years I hope we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
shall be more together; we shall see each other
every day."</p>

<p>Robt. Graham to Mrs. Carr, from Lexington,
July 9: "Your letter was duly received,
and I immediately set to work to see what
could be done to get you into the Midway Orphan
School. I handed your letter to Brother
McGarvey, and he agreed with me that there
is little likelihood of the trustees placing the
management under the control of a lady. I
consulted members of the executive committee,
and find they are resolved upon a man. It is
very difficult to find the right one. Keith of
California refused at once; Bartholomew of
Louisville has a better position, etc. It is suggested
that you buy the now vacant school at
North Middleton, Bourbon County, and while
I could not advise you to such a step, I mention
it, that you may know of that opening. I see
that Corinth Academy is for sale, but I don't
suppose you would want to put your means
there. Brother Patterson holds on for another
year at Hamilton College. I can easily understand
why you seek to be engaged in a school
where you could work for the Cause we love;
were it in my power, I would soon have you in
a position more congenial to your tastes. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
it is, you must be content to labor and to wait,
till God opens up the way. I write this, knowing
you have a position of great honor and
emolument, one that many would gladly obtain;
but I know your desire, and sympathize with
it."</p>

<p>More notes from Mr. Carr, as State Evangelist,
to Mrs. Carr&mdash;July 18: "Letters forwarded.
You don't miss me any more than I
do you. I am going to hold some meetings
during pleasant weather. I have very few additions
to report. I have spent most of my
time trying to set up torn-down churches. As
to Vice President of the C. W. B. M., I don't
object for that honor to be thrust upon my
wife. I think it very complimentary; get up
the program, and preside at Kansas City.
How about that Biography? If <i>you</i> could
work on that, we would get it out. You
ought to write much for the Brotherhood.
Women can do that work, and not trespass on
I Cor. 14:34-35. Drive out to church and hear
Brother Powell, Sunday. Don't forget to fix
up the genealogy of the Rogers family. Don't
try to drive that horse by yourself. While you
are resting, select the essays to be added to the
second part of the Biography. Don't work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
hard, just lounge around, for this is your vacation,
you know.</p>

<p>"August 6. While at Savannah I received
some letters forwarded by you to '<i>Sullivan</i>.'
How they came to Savannah, marked thus,
I don't know, I suppose there is no such
postoffice as Sullivan, and they might as well
come here as anywhere. Halt!&mdash;I had to go
out to preach my ten o'clock sermon. I am
preaching day and night. It's a hard row to
hoe. The church is in a deplorable condition,
and of course nobody will 'join.' But I am
expected to stay up here, and keep digging.
Brother J. H. Duncan asked me to help make
out the C. W. B. M. program for the State
meeting. Isn't he impudent? I told him you
are president, and will manage it; but I helped
him on the <i>male</i> part.</p>

<p>"November 27. This is Thanksgiving Day,
and I am to eat at a hall&mdash;a dinner by the
Methodists. I'm a good hand to eat for the
benefit of a church. I hear they're going to
have ice cream. Well, I can't help it. I must
go. You will have to be thankful without me;
I'll be as thankful as I can. We are to have a
Thanksgiving sermon by a North Methodist
preacher, and coming so soon after Cleveland's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
election, it is anticipated he will give us a
gloomy kind of thanks. He will doubtless feel
somewhat as Dr. Pinkerton did, when he told
his wife he had nothing to be thankful
for because there was no butter. Our meeting
drags. I had to get this part of the county
fixed up and friendly. There is a good prospect
now. Received account from Brother D.
O. Smart. Sorry I could not be with you and
the young ladies and gentlemen at 'Narrow
Gauge' today."</p>

<p>From the Missionary <i>Tidings</i>, September,
1884: "Mrs. O. A. Carr of Columbia has been
appointed vice-president of the C. W. B. M. of
Missouri, to succeed Mrs. J. W. Morris, who
was compelled to resign on account of ill health."
The reader is referred to past files of the
<i>Tidings</i> for a full account of Mrs. Carr's labors
as organizer, platform manager, speaker, and
her committee work in the C. W. B. M. She
was vice president in 1884, 1885, 1886, after
which she became a State manager. During
her first vice-presidency, the managers were
Mmes. Hedges, A. B. Jones, J. H. Garrison, J.
W. Monser, Dr. Petitt, T. E. Baskett, T. D.
Strong, E. C. Browning, Kirk Baxter, Wm.
Pruitt; during each of her terms, the secretary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
was Miss M. Lou Payne. In 1887 she was succeeded
by Mrs. J. K. Rogers.</p>

<p>On the 20th of March, 1885, the St. Louis
publisher, John Burns, writes to O. A. Carr:
"Last Friday I went to Columbia and had a
pleasant interview with Sister Rogers about
publishing her book. We agreed that the matter
should be delayed no longer. The MS.
should be in my hands with the least possible
delay. It should be in type by the first of
May, and the books ready by June 1st. As
you are so constantly engaged away from home
as our State Evangelist, it is thought best for
Brother Mountjoy to read the proof. As to
compensation for labors, Sister Rogers stated
that she is anxious for you to be satisfied. I
have agreed to bring out the work in first-class
style. There is to be a steel engraving of
Brother Rogers, and a wood cut of Christian
College. The work will be in two bindings,
one to be full Turkey Morocco, gilt. The John
Burns Publishing Company will have entire
control of the work, and have agreed to push
the sale to the best of their ability. I expected
to meet Mrs. Carr, to discuss the matter with
her, but could not delay my stay in Columbia."</p>

<p>At the foot of the foregoing, Mr. Carr writes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
a hurried note to his wife, on enclosing her the
letter: "I wrote Brother Burns that I would
rather trust you to read the proof than anybody.
I am afraid I cannot get the work done,
even next month. I have to settle a church
here."</p>

<p>While churches are thus wrangling among
themselves, and sinners are standing aloof,
taking notes on the War of the Christians, and
the Biography is apparently fated never to get
itself into type, Mrs. Maria Jameson, national
president of the C. W. B. M., writes to Mrs.
Carr: "I read your letter to the Board, and
there was a unanimous expression of gratification
at its contents. You are one of the women
among us who can make public addresses.
Now, if you are willing, we will utilize this talent.
Public lectures, properly advertised, designed
to attract attention to missionary work,
particularly to the work of our women, might
do great good. Of course, you will have to use
judgment in selecting the places for the addresses.
No provision has been made for an
outlay of money in this matter, as we can ill
afford to divert a dollar from regular work. I
believe, as a public speaker, you will spread the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
name, and strengthen the influence, of the
Christian Woman's Board of Missions."</p>

<p>W. B. Johnson of the Christian Publishing
Company, St. Louis, to Mrs. Carr: "Your
C. W. B. M. notes will appear in next week's
paper; and I will also speak of the University,
and of your work there."</p>

<p>M. B. Mason, Principal Meadville Public
Schools, to Mrs. Carr: "We intend to celebrate
Whittier's birthday with suitable entertainment.
Will you please send some suggestions
regarding arrangements, program, etc?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Maria Jameson to Mrs. Carr, November
1: "Ever since our parting, I have purposed
writing to express the pleasure given me
by an increased acquaintance with you. During
our recent convention, I learned to feel constantly
that I had an able ally, quick to see
what was needed in an emergency, and able to
act intelligently and promptly. I wish you
would write occasionally to me during the year;
so many new sides of things are evolved by
talking them over. My daughter and son-in-law
are back from their trip abroad, and, of
course, I have not had time for much, besides
talking to them; but in a short time my
thoughts will be turned to our work. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
the help and blessing of God, I will do everything
in my power this year for its development.
Let 'For Christ's sake' be our motto, and in
his blessed name we shall do many wonderful
things. Pray always with me, and for me, my
dear sister, that we may prove faithful until
the end."</p>

<p>Enough has been said about Mr. Carr's work
as State Evangelist&mdash;his work of several years,&mdash;to
suggest the arduous nature of that labor.
Passing by any further details, we turn for a
moment to the Biography, which did, after all,
find its way into cloth and Morocco, in 1885,
under the title, "Memorial of J. K. Rogers
and History of Christian College."</p>

<p>The book is divided into three parts: the
first, of about 200 pages, is devoted to the
Life, Letters and Addresses of J. K. Rogers;
the second, of some 30 pages, is called "History
of Christian College"; while the third of about
100 pages, bears the title&mdash;"Some Essays and
Poems of Pupils of Christian College, Edited
by Mrs. O. A. Carr, Principal of the Ladies
Department of the University of the State of
Missouri."</p>

<p>This Part Third of the Memorial, is the only
work left by Mrs. Carr, in book form. As we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
have seen, she undertook the editorship of the
collection of essays and poems of the Alumnae,
at the request of her husband, in order to
hasten the publication of the book.</p>

<p>Joseph Kirtley Rogers was born in Fayette
County, Kentucky, in 1828. When he was
two years of age, his parents left Lexington on
a thirty days' journey to the wild and Indian-infested
West, pitching their tent finally about
twelve miles west of Palmyra, Missouri. Here
they lived in their log cabin. "Game was
abundant," says the Memorial; "panthers
screamed, wolves howled; bears roamed the
thick woods; deer were a common sight, and
wild turkeys hovered in the tree tops." It was
near the birthplace and boyhood scenes of Mark
Twain, and the author of "Tom Sawyer" had
no need to go outside of Marion County to find
the original of his "Colonel Mulberry Sellers."</p>

<p>When William Muldrow with others, borrowed
$20,000 to establish "a great college"&mdash;Marion
College&mdash;on the western prairie, purchasing
therewith 4,969 acres, and confidently
expecting a future hay crop to reimburse the
teachers, he fathered a scheme that the "colonel"
might have joyfully laid out with his
toothpick upon his tablecloth. To this college<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
Rogers went,&mdash;until it died; then he attended
the University at Columbia.</p>

<p>Christian College was the first institution for
the collegiate education of Protestant women
to receive a charter from the Legislature of
Missouri. The enterprise was largely due to
the work of D. P. Henderson, minister of the
Christian Church at Columbia, and Dr. Samuel
Hatch and Prof. Henry H. White of Bacon
College, Harrodsburg, Ky. When Jas. Shannon
of Bacon College, was elected to the presidency
of Missouri University, he recommended
a former pupil for the presidency of the contemplated
college. This pupil, John Augustus
Williams, held the position from the opening of
Christian College until 1856, when he resigned
to establish Daughters College at Harrodsburg.
It is an odd coincidence that Williams
should have gone from Columbia to Harrodsburg
in time to shape the educational life and
ideals of Mrs. Carr, and that Mrs. Carr should,
in the course of years, have come from Harrodsburg
to Columbia, to act as associate principal
in the college inaugurated by her favorite
teacher.</p>

<p>John Augustus Williams was succeeded at
Christian College by L. B. Wilkes. During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
the latter's administration, J. K. Rogers from
Marion County, Mo., acted as instructor; at the
close of President Wilkes' second year, Rogers
became the third president of the institution; a
position which he occupied for nearly twenty
years, and which only a fatal disease compelled
him to relinquish. During his administration
there were 174 graduates, and it was the difficulty
of hearing from so many, that delayed the
Memorial.</p>

<p>George S. Bryant was the fourth president,&mdash;from
1877 to 1884. His successor, W. A.
Oldham, had scarcely finished his first year,
when the Memorial was published. The book
is true to its title; it is rather a Memorial than
a biography, the work of a friend, who prefers
to quote such men as G. W. Longan, J. W.
McGarvey, etc., rather than to substitute
words of his own.</p>

<p>And if the life of a minister who, for twenty
years, occupies the same chair in a school of
learning, lacks the variety which gives to biography
an interest to the general reader, still
less can the history of that school be offered as
a work of entertainment. Something more
may be said for the part edited by Mrs. Carr.
Whatever lack of merit her collection of essays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
and poems reveals, may be charged to the
paucity and immaturity of the material in her
hands. It is fair to conclude that she gave us
the best that the alumnae gave her; and the
impression that most of it might just as well
not have been preserved, is dissipated when we
are told that President Rogers was anxious to
have the writings of his girls published as his
memorial, even if no word be said about himself.
Viewed, then, not as literature, but as
the fruits of his instruction, these writings,
breathing the deepest piety, and revealing both
learning and grace, hold their fitting place in
the memorial to the Christian teacher.</p>

<p>But it is because this Part Third reveals the
mind of her who edits it, that it is of moment
to our biography. In the first chapter she gives
us an indication of what she regards as of the
utmost value in a woman's life:</p>

<p>"In looking over the scores of letters I have
received from the Alumnae of Christian College,
I find that I have written on the envelopes
of about nine out of ten, the word, <i>Christian</i>;
on two out of ten, the word, <i>teacher</i>; and on
each without exception, the golden word,
<i>home-worker</i>. In this statistical catalogue of
three words, is found the grandest record of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
Christian College. That the life-work of its
Alumnae has been chiefly confined to the
church, and the school-room, and the home, is
its honor and renown."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr thus sues for toleration of "a
wrong spirit" manifested in an essay on the
"South." "Though the author evinces a little
bitterness, we should forgive her. She
wrote at the close of our sad civil war. When
she writes vigorously and touchingly of 'A
Washington, a Jefferson, a Calhoun, a Clay,
a Breckenridge, a Benton,' when she proudly
says, 'Behold on Virginia's consecrated ground,
noble Bethany College, and Virginia's magnificent
University,' when she turns lovingly to
'Kentucky University, one of the proudest in
the Union,' and when, in the full bound of her
loyalty she clasps to her heart her 'own Missouri
University,'&mdash;then indeed we forgive, and
our heart rejoices with hers in a common love."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr thus introduces her third chapter:
"If no George Eliot was found in the previous
chapter, so no Elizabeth Barrett Browning will
be found in this. If the reader be generous,
he will find some very sweet poetic thought expressed
in verse; but he will feel no deep stirrings
of an angelic genius, that looks through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
Casa Guida window up to the very gates of
heaven. He will find only the rhythmical outpourings
of ambitious girlish hearts; and if he
laugh at their imperfections, he will only prove
that his heart is old&mdash;" Reader, let us not delve
into these ambitious poems, lest we laugh and
prove ourselves no longer young. Let us
come away, after noting this comment on a
poem entitled 'Longfellow.'</p>

<p>"Having once met him in his poet-home,"
says Mrs. Carr, "having felt the warm pressure
of his hand, heard the low music of his voice,
looked into the clear depth of his poetic eye&mdash;having
felt, in short, the benediction of his
presence, I find in the following simple dirge, a
peculiar charm. That the modest author so
tenderly loved her nation's poet, whose song
like his own flower-de-luce, shall 'make forever
the world more fair and sweet,' evinces both a
refined taste, and a cultured heart."</p>

<p>Gone, now, that good white poet, to mingle
in the poesy of the past; and vanished is she
who felt the warm pressure of his hand, and
looked into the clear depth of his poetic eye.
But the world is here as when they trod it
beneath its daily sun; and here are you and I.
Happy are we, if we find the world more fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
and sweet because of those who have breathed
their influence upon it.</p>

<p>So we lay aside this Memorial, the joint work
of Mr. and Mrs. Carr, the only book they ever
produced, and go on with the story of their
lives&mdash;a story full of incessant work, its routine
broken by some such adventures as is suggested
by the following from Anthony Haynes to
Mrs. Carr: "You are invited to read a paper
before the State Teachers' Association which
meets at Sweet Springs, March 22-24, 1886.
Your cabinet is just the thing we wish to see
at the Display&mdash;bring it."</p>

<p>From Mr. Carr to Mrs. Carr, June 6th&mdash;showing
that Mrs. Carr has her eyes unalterably
set upon the future: "There is no advertisement
of phonography in the <i>Cincinnati
Enquirer</i> or the <i>Courier-Journal</i>. So you
have learned the shorthand alphabet! Well,
I am sure it will require a great deal of practice
to report verbatim. I do want you to take a
rest this summer, whether you learn phonography
or not. The truth is, you ought to be
resting now."</p>

<p>But the report of the Fourth Annual Convention
of the Women's Christian Temperance
Union shows that Mrs. Carr was doing anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
but resting. The "Irrepressible Conflict"
of this year, shows her laboring sturdily
for temperance. Further letters show her
struggling at spare moments with shorthand.
What will she do with <i>that</i>? This from Mrs.
S. E. Shortridge of the C. W. B. M., suggests
a new activity:</p>

<p>"Sister Jameson was very much pleased with
the card of flowers you sent her. She is very
greatly improved&mdash;able to see and enjoy her
friends. We had a most delightful conference
with her last Sunday afternoon. Brother
Azbill, Dr. and Mrs. Pearre, A. M. Atkinson
and wife were there, besides the member of the
board, and others. Mrs. Jameson is still confined
to her bed. She sends her love and says
she will write very soon. Perhaps you can get
your leaflet printed at Kansas City. The C.
W. B. M. will highly appreciate your kindness
in the preparation of a leaflet, in the midst of
your various duties and obligations. There is
a growing demand for such information. I am
anxiously awaiting its appearance."</p>

<p>In the same year, O. A. Carr attended a
meeting of the Alumni of Kentucky University,
and in a public address, thus referred to his
own graduating class: "The class of 1867<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
has never appeared on this rostrum since commencement
day nineteen years ago. We were
three then; we are two now. We were called
the Trio. For nigh six years of student life
we were boon companions. We shared our
mutual joys, our mutual burdens bore, in a
most intimate friendship. We planned our
future so that our paths might often cross each
other, but duty called us to labor in fields as
far apart as Colorado, California, Australia.
When James C. Keith, President of Pierce
Christian College, California, and I were corresponding,
concerning this meeting of today,
our hearts cried out for the absent one&mdash;the
noble, generous, gifted, brilliant valedictorian
of our class. In the hearts of those who knew
him, there arises, as a sweet fragrance, the
memory of Albert Myles."</p>

<p>Not long after the delivery of this tribute,
Mrs. O. A. Burgess wrote to Mrs. Carr: "I
was in Indianapolis a few weeks ago, and found
our dear Sister Jameson better than I hoped.
I had a delightful visit with her. She realizes
that she is soon to leave us, but is as bright and
cheerful as she ever was in her life, and her interest
in the C. W. B. M. is unabated. Allow
me to congratulate you on the rapid growth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
the C. W. B. M. in Missouri. You certainly
must have efficient workers. Your article on
'How to Organize an Auxiliary' will meet a
long felt need."</p>

<p>November 27, 1886, Mrs. Shortridge wrote:
"Am sending you our amended Constitution
and the December <i>Tidings</i>. In the list of
Missouri officers you will notice your name as a
manager. I hope you will approve. The relation
between yourself as Vice President, and
the Executive Committee, has been so pleasant
and congenial, that we are unwilling to sever it
altogether. We need your help, and will be
grateful at any time for suggestions. Your
leaflet, you so kindly prepared, has been most
useful to me in answering the question, How to
Organize; and it has been a means of encouragement
to a great many timid sisters. Indeed,
my dear sister, when I think how promptly
you have responded to my requests for help,
how your loving words of appreciation have
lifted me up when almost discouraged and
ready to give up the struggle,&mdash;the tears come
to my eyes, and I ask God to bless you
abundantly."</p>

<p>The leaflet referred to, is by Mrs. Carr, as
President of the Missouri State Board, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
addressed to "The 39,000 Missouri Sisters
who wear the badge of the C. W. B. M." It
is an eloquent and logical presentation of the
value of organization.</p>

<p>From Mrs. Maria Jameson, came the following,
October 4, 1886: "Your loving message
with the pretty card was received with heartfelt
thanks to God, who has given me the love of
so many warm hearts. Surely in this regard,
never was woman more blessed. With humble
heart I accept it as one of the ways the kind
Father 'is making his grace sufficient for me.'
Of course, I am thinking much of the Kansas
City convention. You and I have begun an
acquaintance so pleasant&mdash;you enter so readily
and heartily into my views and plans&mdash;so ready
to render me judicious and active assistance,
that I looked forward with increased pleasure
to the labor of coming years. But 'man proposes
and God disposes.' I almost dare think
that He wished to give me a special lesson of
the absolute dependence of all my plans upon
His sovereign will. When I knew beyond a
doubt that I could not be present, the question
rose, Who will occupy the vacant chair? One
day it flashed across my mind that now we had
the opportunity of making a graceful public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
testimonial of our respect to the woman whom
the C. W. B. M. delights to honor&mdash;Mrs.
Pearre, who is this year, for almost the first
time, free from school duties. You, as Vice
President, will open the convention's sessions
with the usual exercises. Mrs. Pearre's name
will be received by acclamation, and you will
conduct her to the chair, and give her all the
help and encouragement you would have given
me, staying beside her, informing her and supporting
her according to requirement. What
shall I say of myself? I have through all my
life received wondrous good from God; shall I
not patiently receive evil, also? Pray earnestly
for me, that I may cheerfully yes, joyfully,
submit to His will."</p>

<p>In 1887, O. A. Carr went to Arkansas to
look about for a promising field, where he
might labor in the ministry, and his wife, in
her own chosen profession. He writes from
Fort Smith: "I lectured last night to a moderate
audience. We have a neat little frame
church here. The preacher has been re-elected;
22 for, 12 against. I am sorry for him; but he
is going to stick to them. He is a pleasant
man, and very kind. They are remarkably
hospitable here. I send you a little bouquet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
from the front yard. Think of violets and
roses, a month ahead of the Missouri bloom!
You will recognize the two large leaves; they
are maple! It is now about as warm as a June
day at home. I don't believe you could have
any success here during the summer, in teaching
elocution and phonography; for I am told
that the people take holiday during the summer
months, and take it very extensively&mdash;even
the laboring men, because they are afraid to
work much. People are dropping in here
quietly, buying, and slipping out. There will
probably be a rise in property after the bridge
is built into the Indian Territory. Work is
begun on a U. S. court room and new post
office. There is tied up in this nosegay a great
deal of love for my wife. I go to Alma tomorrow."
(So <i>now</i> we begin to understand
what that short hand meant! There are to
be no more vacations, it seems.)</p>

<p>April 13th, Mr. Carr wrote from Fayetteville,
Arkansas: "Brother Ragland tries to
convince me that we ought to come here, and
establish a Young Ladies' College, in connection
with the University&mdash;but young ladies attend
the University. He says our church has
no school in Arkansas, and Fayetteville is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
educational center, etc. Brother Robt. Graham
started a college here in 1858 and continued it
successfully until the war broke it up in 1862.
His college building was burned. He had five
acres, most beautiful site. His residence is
standing yet. I attended the opening exercises
at the University. Some of the professors remembered
you; they heard your lecture at
Sweet Springs. The University is upon a hill
and is imposing. I could not make an arrangement
for a meeting at Fort Smith, because it is
cotton-planting time, and the people are very
busy. After preaching at Alma two days (and
receiving $6) I came here. I will stop at
Springfield, Mo., tonight, and may remain over
Sunday, as I am told they have no preacher.
I have seen several young ladies and talked up
Christian College, distributed catalogues, etc.,
but they object that Columbia is too far away."</p>

<p>Mr. Carr, from Springfield, Mo., May 13th,
showing that Springfield is beginning to enter
largely into his life; "I preached last night on
'Quench not the Spirit,' and ended the Ash
Grove meeting. The sale of the college is
postponed sixty days. Sister Bander said my
sermon was much needed. There now! she is
a judge. They want you to send some of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
tracts on 'How to Organize an Auxiliary' here,
to Springfield."</p>

<p>Mr. Carr from Paris, Ky., June 9th: "I received
your good letter, and was reading it in
Morrison Chapel, as I sat beside Alex. Milligan.
He saw the flowers enclosed, and said,
'I thought you were over that!' I told him
that was an old bachelor's idea of the matter&mdash;just
as though true love would ever get over it!
I told Brother McGarvey what was in your letter.
It is all right; but Brother Graham asked
at first, if it was wise for you to give up your
work at the University. When I see you, I'll
tell you about Hamilton College. I am here
over night with Minnie Fox. John is home
from New York on a visit. We talked so late
last night that I could scarcely get up this
morning! Saw Brother Grubbs at Lexington.
Monday I take the boat for Cincinnati, and
expect to be in St. Louis at the Union Depot,
Tuesday morning next. I had a fine sleep on
the <i>St. Lawrence</i>, and didn't wake up till the
boat whistled for Maysville. I hurried up and
found mother busy skimming milk. She can
not walk far; her ankle seems to be ossifying.
She is all the while anxious about the children
for whom she has worn out her strength. If I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
had not engaged at Springfield, I might have
gone to Mt. Sterling or Louisville. I don't
know but what Springfield is as good a place
for regular employment as the other places.
The idea is to be content, and do the work
well. I want you to have a year's good rest.
Now is your time to rest. Get the good out of
old Jeff. Make him flutter around. I think
he had better be sold to some one in Columbia
where he is known. Minnie Fox is a fine girl.
She says she would love to be with you in
Springfield. John is home now for vacation,
but is going to the coal mines in Southern
Kentucky" (where his fancy is one day to follow
the trail of the Lonesome Pine, and discover
a little shepherd herding the sheep in "Kingdom
Come.") "He says he would like to be one
of the Assistants at the University. I told him
you are going to rest, and he wants to know
whether there would be a chance for him to get
in. He could bring testimonials&mdash;his Harvard
diploma would be something. If you think
well of it, you could present his name. He took
the honors at Harvard, and has been tutoring
in New York ever since. He is a teacher by
education and by nature. Do as you think
best about it."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>
<p>From the foregoing it is clear that Mrs. Carr has
definitely decided to relinquish her post of
service at the University of Missouri. That she
needed rest, there can be no doubt. That she
needed undivided time in which to mature
plans for her future college, against the day of
opportunity, is equally certain. At Springfield,
Missouri, Mr. Carr entered upon a three
year's service. As soon as Mrs. Carr could
sever her connections with the University, she
joined him.</p>

<p>Her work for the C. W. B. M. still continued.
We find her delivering addresses, arranging
programs, and lecturing. Mrs. Jameson, Mrs.
Pearre, Mrs. Shortridge, etc., continue to write
her for wise counsel, in grave times of anxious
consideration&mdash;for instance, when the Constitution
was altered, when plans were on foot to
make the <i>Tidings</i> a stronger magazine, etc.
When Mrs. Carr ceased to hold an official position
under the C. W. B. M. the appeals to her
for advice and help came just as frequently as
when she was President of the State Board.</p>

<p>Her work in the W. C. T. U. was also
unabated, and during 1888, she took an active
part in the prohibition candidacy of John A.
Brooks for the governorship. A letter from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
E. C. Browning requests Mrs. Carr to do the
C. W. B. M. work of Mrs. Browning, whom
ill-health prevents from performing her duties
as manager in Southern Missouri. She is also
engaged in lecturing on her tour of the world,
taking opportunity as she goes from city to
city, to investigate the prospects for a new
college.</p>

<p>In the <i>Nevada Daily Democrat</i> of October
11th, we find this estimate of Mrs. Carr as a
public lecturer: "The lady reads her lecture
from manuscript, and has a very plain, clear
voice which can be distinctly heard all over the
room. Her diction is fine. She is, indeed, a
pleasant reader, almost perfect in her pronunciation
and emphasis."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>ACHIEVING ONE'S IDEAL.</h3>


<p>The six years following Mrs. Carr's
connection with the University of the
State of Missouri, might be characterized
as the time of preparation,
struggle and victory; preparation in
the definite formulation of plans for her last
educational experience; struggle to find the
suitable place and the requisite means for the
establishment of her college, and the victory of
final achievement. This period extends from
1888 to 1894.</p>

<p>As we have seen, it was Mr. Carr's earnest
desire for his wife to take a long rest, on his
acceptance of the church at Springfield; and
no attentive reader of Mrs. Carr's life can
doubt the need of rest at this time&mdash;a rest
which, in her case, meant keeping house&mdash;the
every-day work of many women.</p>

<p>While she rests, this biography may also rest,
in the respect of dealing with events, since the
occurrences in the simple life are most enjoyed
in proportion as they make dull reading, and
the days at Springfield were happy days.</p>

<p>To illustrate Mrs. Carr's force of character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
it may be related that one day when her finger
was cut off, she found the dismembered part in
the folding door, quickly fastened the end back
in place, and held it there till help could be
summoned.</p>

<p>A brief note from the Ladies Aid Society of
Sheldon, Missouri, asking if Mrs. Carr can
come to deliver a lecture in their interests, must
be taken as an example of countless others of a
similar nature. The following statement from
the President of the Missouri University, fitly
serves as a transition from former experiences,
to the new phase of Mrs. Carr's career. It is
addressed to her:</p>

<p>"During my administration of the Missouri
University for thirteen years, you occupied
faithfully and efficiently and acceptably the
position of Lady Principal, for eight or ten
years. This position you resigned of your own
choice. It was not done at the advice, or the
instance, of either the Board or the President
of the institution. You had always done considerable
teaching, as well as serving as Principal,
and it was always my understanding that
it was not your pleasure to hold the position
apart from teaching; and as the care had so
grown as to make that overburdensome, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
you withdrew, a successor was appointed who
has never done any teaching. As a matter of
fact, when you resigned, I did not fully understand
your reason for doing so. Allow me to
express my appreciation for your great worth as
an educator, and to assure you of my earnest
hope that your enterprise at Sherman will more
than realize your purposes and expectations."</p>

<p>This letter from Dr. S. S. Laws was written
in 1891, which brings us rather prematurely to
the subject of "Sherman." The reader will
find that in the course of events, all interests
will presently center in that Texas city; but, as
we have said, Mrs. Carr is now resting (1888-9)
and the biography, as a chronicle of events,
rests with her.</p>

<p>But while household cares engage her time,
her mind is ever active with that great idea of
her life which has attended her since childhood
days, and which we are, in the course of time,
to find bringing her to the highest fulfillment
of her powers. We have seen how that tireless
nature has fought its way from battlefield to
battlefield, ever progressing in its educational
career. It is not clearly defined to her judgment
how, or where, she is to take the final
stand in her work of improving the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
number of girls in the most effective way, yet,
by following the clews given in the following
letters, we may trace out her course to its final
destination.</p>

<p>But if Mrs. Carr has temporarily entered into
what we may call&mdash;as distinguished from other
years&mdash;her period of rest, the following clipping
from a newspaper dated, May, 1889, will indicate
that Mr. Carr has been far otherwise
engaged:</p>

<p>"Sunday night, O. A. Carr stated to his
congregation that he had a secret of several
months' standing which he was agonizing to
disclose. The long cherished hope of his congregation,
and indeed of the North Town disciples
was about to be realized&mdash;the erection of
a church building in North Springfield. He said
the money is already raised and the building
will begin as soon as specifications are determined
upon. He stated that the disciples of
Christ with whom he had been meeting in the
Good Templars' Hall, for nearly two years,
would begin, next Sunday, regular church
work preparatory to entering their new church
home in the near future. With the dawning
light of the permanent prosperity of the church
of North Springfield filling their hearts, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
congregation was dismissed, and the scene of
rejoicing that followed cannot be described."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr in commenting upon this news,
adds, "North Springfield has a population of
about 10,000, and a struggling little band of
Christians have been praying and working for
the above happy consummation, for years."</p>

<p>This brief news-item reveals, to those who
have built churches, years of labor, anxiety, and
suffering. In the meantime, the quest for a
suitable college opening is never relinquished.
Now that the church is built, one is freer
to look about. Mr. Carr, having served three
years at Springfield, Mo., is invited to come to
Arkansas and examine the field.</p>

<p>"The brethren will help support and establish
a college here," writes G. W. Hudspeth.
"I would like to have it at Little Rock, but do
not know that she would offer as much encouragement
as a smaller town with no college. I
have about 400 lots in a railroad town of which
I will give sufficient grounds for a college building;
and allow the other lots sold, and donate
one-third of the proceeds to the support of the
college."</p>

<p>In December of the same year&mdash;1890&mdash;Mr.
Carr writes from Bates City to Mrs. Carr: "It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
seems to me that the Sherman proposition is
the best that has been made you, and I want
you to see your way clear, and at the same time
I want you to act on your own judgment.
You say you will accept the terms, if they suit.
I hope you will have some word of cheer to send
before long. Do not be gloomy and downcast."</p>

<p>A few days after, the following from J. W.
McGarvey is written to Mr. Carr, showing that
the terms of Sherman were far from persuasive:
"Your letter surprises me, for I thought that
you and Sister Carr had already moved to
Sherman, Texas, and were at work there.
The Broadway Church has engaged Brother
Bartholomew to preach one year, and superintend
the erection of a new house of worship,
after which he returns to St. Louis to build a
new house there. I hope the school at Sherman
has not gone amiss, and that it will not
be affected by the college boom at Dallas."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr, in explaining why Sherman was
chosen as the site for her important venture,
wrote: "After a long and arduous term of
labor as Adjunct Professor and Principal of the
Ladies Department in Missouri State University
my nervous system broke down, and I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
compelled to suspend my work. Mr. Carr accepted
a call to preach at Springfield, Mo., believing
the altitude would conduce to the restoration
of my health. Breathing the ozone of
the Ozarks, I was soon a new creature, and I
determined to resume my professional labors.
The thought, like an inspiration, came to me,
'Build a college for girls, consecrate your life to
it, and <i>leave it as a bequest to the Church</i>.'
I told Mr. Carr of my heart's desire, and after
prayerful consideration, we resolved to devote
our united lives to the work. I visited a number
of towns and cities in Missouri, Tennessee
and Kentucky, seeking a suitable location.
After I had spent a year thus, Mr. Carr went
to Sherman, Texas, to conduct a series of meetings,
and some of the prominent citizens, having
learned what we purposed, expressed a desire
to have the college located at Sherman.
A proposition was submitted, which Mr. Carr
forwarded me at Springfield, advising me to
come and look into the matter. I came,
amused at the idea of locating our life-work in
Texas; but I was then ignorant of her marvelous
developments, and of her still more marvelous
undeveloped resources. I visited a number
of her splendid towns, and ascertained that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
the wide territory of the State, the Church of
Christ owned no college exclusively for girls."</p>

<p>It would be a brief story to say that Sherman
was finally selected and the college built
there; but how, in that case, could the reader
gain a knowledge of the almost insuperable
difficulties overcome? It is by such a knowledge
that we gain the clearest view of Mrs.
Carr's character. She was, no doubt, often
despondent, but she never relinquished her
determination; nor did her zeal cause her to act
too hastily. Although Sherman now appeared
desirable, no stone must be left unturned to
discover if there were towns more promising.</p>

<p>January 18, 1891, we find President J. W.
Ellis writing from Plattsburg College, Missouri,
to Mr. Carr: "I wrote you a hasty note on
receipt of your last. If you had carried the
letter a little longer in your pocket, you might
have weakened it so it might not have got here!
In regard to Sister Carr's quest&mdash;Plattsburg
College is now prosperous and has been for
eleven years. I would be willing to sell it at a
nominal price, to get rest from the long-continued
service of a teacher and his wife. I see no
reason why Sister Carr could not continue the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
flourishing condition of the school. Campus,
four acres, unencumbered, non-taxable."</p>

<p>February 12, 1891, Wm. Frazier wrote Mr.
Carr from Calusa, California: "At the suggestion
of Brethren J. C. Keith and W. P.
Dorsey, I address you this note to say: For
some 14 years, Brother Keith has been President
of Pierce Christian College; lately he sent
in his resignation; we will have to supply his
place. I feel at liberty to ask if you will be
open for engagement next session, beginning
September 1st. I am President of the Board
of Trustees, and the Board looks to me
to attend to these matters. The church at
College City will be without a preacher in June;
so the President of the college will most likely
be called to preach for the church. I ought to
have said that Brother Keith's health has been
poor for three years, and his physicians advise
a change and rest."</p>

<p>O. A. Carr, in forwarding this letter to his
wife, adds, "The above received to-day. I
answered by saying, 'Send on your proposition,
I will consider it.' Why not get an appointment
to lecture at Galveston? You could easily
run down there from Sherman, and see the
place."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. Carr to Mrs. Carr, March 2nd: "I have
just written to Brother Keith in full asking all
the questions you suggested, and several
besides. I told him we would come, and I
could begin preaching for the church right
away. I asked him to send you a catalogue at
Sherman. It may be that the California plan
is better than the Texas one. I have but one
objection, which I waive for your sake&mdash;I will
be so far away from my kin, and the friends of
early days. Besides, you know I prefer preaching
to teaching; but I suppose I could do both
at College City, after a fashion. So Brother
Capp is to be at Springfield! Well, I would
rather have him succeed me than any one else,
for the good of the church. Address me at
Omaha."</p>

<p>L. B. Wilkes, at Stockton, California, to O.
A. Carr: "I wrote to Brother Frazier. The
place at College City is yours, it seems, if you
want it. You had better have them as a
<i>Board</i>, send an official letter, saying just what
terms they mean to propose. If there's anything
I can do, I am ready."</p>

<p>Wm. Frazier to L. B. Wilkes, March 16th:
"I have written to Sister Carr, making Brother
Carr an offer to take our college, and am now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
anxiously awaiting an answer. What a grand
service you could be to us, Brother Wilkes, if
you could write to Brother Carr and induce
him to come and see our college."</p>

<p>Instead of quoting further, the Pierce College
incident may be summed up as follows: The
Executive Board called Mr. and Mrs. Carr to
Pierce Christian College of California. The
call was accepted. Mrs. Carr gave up the
Sherman idea; all property at their death was
to go to Pierce Christian College; an accident
policy in favor of the college was arranged.
She accordingly wired to College City that she
would be there by the 30th; sold the ponies
and carriage and the household goods at a
sacrifice of about $1,000 (Mr. Carr was then in
Nebraska), and was in due time joined by her
husband.</p>

<p>The ticket agent secured their tickets. They
were on the eve of departure when a message
from the President of the Board called off the
agreement. Opposition had arisen on the
grounds that Mr. Carr did not, in some of his
opinions, accord with all of those on the Board.</p>

<p>Mr. Carr, under the blow of this disappointment,
wrote to Mr. Frazier as follows: "Your
reasons for withdrawing your offer are as great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
a surprise to me as was the telegram announcing
the fact. I stand where Brothers Wilkes,
Keith, Graham, McGarvey and Grubbs stand.
I emphatically encourage and practice progression
heavenward. I will not desert the cause
of Christ for the fashion of the giddy world.
Having no children, Mrs. Carr has been planning
for several years to locate in a college
which, at my death, would receive our money.
We had decided upon Pierce Christian College.
I tell you this that you may know how completely
you have upset our plans."</p>

<p>The foregoing is introduced into this biography
merely by way of illustrating the difficulties
with which the Carrs were forced to contend,
before the final victory.</p>

<p>Thus is the California incident closed. The
Carrs once more find themselves beset by uncertainties.
Mr. Carr writes to their Springfield
friend, Mrs. Weaver, showing how one
pauses irresolutely before various openings:</p>

<p>"I have been preaching at Council Bluffs, of
late. I haven't yet decided where I shall labor.
I am waiting to hear from different points, and
then we'll go somewhere. President J. W.
Ellis of Plattsburg, Mo., offers us his college.
I don't know about it. There is no offer so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
good as Sherman, I think. Tell Miss Kate to
write to me in shorthand if she likes. I leave
the other side of this sheet for Mattie to say
her say."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr adds: "It is good of you to say
my room is waiting for me. I shall never forget
your kindness, coming just when it was
most needed. I do try to be cheerful and hopeful.
We have the comfort that we have tried
all along to do our duty, to the best of our
ability. I believe the Lord has a bright day in
store for us, by and by, if we will only be
patient and stand for the right."</p>

<p>June 23rd, F. W. Smith wrote to Mrs. Carr
answering her questions regarding the Tennessee
Female College at Franklin. He hesitates
to advise her to accept it, but believes she
could make of it a success, and assures her of
his hearty support should she undertake the
work there.</p>

<p>About the same time, W. J. Loos writes to
Mr. Carr from Louisville: "We have your
article from the <i>Guide</i>; had just received a note
from Mrs. Carr covering the same ground. I
will keep an eye on the field, and if I see any
favorable opening, will let you know. I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
you ought to appear more frequently in the
<i>Guide</i>."</p>

<p>In 1891, the Carrs are thinking of going to
Kentucky with their enterprise. In September,
Mr. Carr writes to Mrs. Carr from "Brother
McGarvey's study": "Brother Bartholomew
says he will prepare you a prospective so that a
cut can be made from it, of the college building,
if you will give him the idea as to size, etc., and
that it can be done in three or four days. For
his work, he will charge nothing, but he will
have to pay the man who does the drawing for
the cut, and the cut will cost about $15."
Tentative diagrams at this time, show that
Mrs. Carr was making her own designs,
arranging the rooms of her college&mdash;wherever
it was to be&mdash;to suit her own ideas. It is no
easy matter to make the cut of our college before
there is any college. Still it must be done,
to bring the scheme tangibly before the public,
and one's imagination must become fixed in
steel.</p>

<p>September 9th, Mrs. Carr writes Mrs.
Weaver from Omaha: "I hope to be with you
next week. I shall be in Springfield only a few
days, I presume. Then I shall go on to Sherman,
to begin the College enterprise. My love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
to Tillie." (Tillie was Mrs. Weaver's little
daughter.) "Tell the dear child to have a
dozen kisses ready for me."</p>

<p>Affairs seem to be crystalizing in and about
Sherman, Texas. A site is provisionally chosen
for the proposed college, "on a beautiful elevation,"
says Mrs. Carr, "in her eastern suburb,
overlooking an immense circuit of country, as
charming as the bluegrass region of our native
State."</p>

<p>A mass meeting of the citizens of Sherman
was called, which Mrs. Carr addresses in the
interests of the enterprise. The arguments she
produces appear to cover all the ground in
sight, and all probable contingencies of the
future. She says:</p>

<p>"If another girls college be established in
Sherman, it will bring among you many more
girls. They, in boarding-school vocabulary,
will 'get awful hungry,' and must be fed. Our
grocers will have to order a large supply of
boarding-school staples, and our meat markets
will have to multiply their sirloin roasts and
porterhouse steaks. These girls will have boxes
of roast turkey and French candies smuggled
to them by sympathetic mamas, and nature in
her mercy, will send a wave of nausea, and a cry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
will go up for our Homeopathic M. D. with his
pleasant little pills, or for our old school dignified
Regular with his calomel and quinine, or
for our cautious Eclectic with his 'best' from
all schools, and each will add to his list of patients,
and our druggists will multiply their
prescriptions, and their profits. These girls
will delight in pretty dresses and becoming
hats&mdash;." And so the dry goods stores will
have their innings, and the milliners. Hope is
next held out to the bookstores, the music supply
companies, the opera house, the street car
lines, etc.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is not so apparent what advantage
the new college may be to those institutions
already established in the city. But Mrs.
Carr promptly takes up this point, and elucidates
it with faultless logic:</p>

<p>"For example, Miss Smith, who is a member
of the Christian Church, comes from Galveston,
and attends the Christian College of Sherman.
She is pleased with the school and delighted
with our town. When she returns home, at
the close of her session she tells her intimate
Baptist friend, Miss Jones, and her intimate
Methodist friend, Miss Brown, what a delightful
place Sherman is, and how 'jolly' it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
be for all to go to school in the same town, etc.
What is the result? The following September
Sherman Institute opens its doors to Miss Jones,
and North Texas Female College welcomes Miss
Brown. But that is not all. Miss Jones of
Galveston has a brother who must be sent to
college, and, with the true impulse of an affectionate
sister, she says, 'Oh, brother Jimmie,
get papa to send you to Austin College, or
Mahan's Commercial College; and you can
come to see me every Saturday.' Therefore, all
the Baptists and Methodists of Sherman ought
to encourage our enterprise to the extent of
their financial ability."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr proceeds to point out how the
building of her college will give employment to
carpenters, brick masons, carters, etc., how it
will help fill the purses of the dealers in hardware
and furniture, and carpets, and coal, etc.,
until most of the industries known to man are
shown to be directly concerned.</p>

<p>"What I have said has been chiefly from a
financial standpoint," she concludes, "but I
know you love Sherman for Sherman's sake,
and glory in her educational and religious progress.
I believe you have the gallant Southern
pride, and the intensely earnest desire for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
education of women, to prompt at least one
hundred and fifty of you to contribute to this
enterprise at least $200 each, especially when
you get in return a good-sized lot in one of the
most beautiful suburbs of one of Texas' most
beautiful cities."</p>

<p>So the success of the enterprise is to depend,
it seems, upon the sale of college-lots&mdash;an old
story, and usually, a sad one! We shall see
how it succeeds in this instance.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mrs. A. M. Laws, wife of
the President of Missouri University, writes to
Mrs. Carr, January 16, 1892: "I am glad you
feel so much encouragement in your new enterprise.
If there is such a thing as a fire-proof
building, you ought to build fire-proof. I suppose
you have heard of the calamity that has
befallen our University. It is all in ruins.
Last Saturday night a fire destroyed the entire
building with its contents. Only the museum
specimens, and law library, were saved, and
not all of that. But already steps have been
taken to rebuild and on a grander scale than
before. In the meantime the classes are meeting
in various places, all over town. All the
portraits and statuary are gone to ashes. Mr.
Laws' large oil portrait, and two other crayon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
portraits of him in the society halls, and one of
myself, are destroyed. We will be glad to hear
of your success in the new enterprise. Mr.
Laws joins me in love and best wishes for a
new year."</p>

<p>At last, O. A. Carr comes back from holding
meetings in Kentucky, and joins his wife at
Sherman. Mrs. Carr, on February 2nd,
writes to her Springfield friend, Mrs. Weaver:
"I need not attempt to tell you how happy I
am to be with my husband once more. He
says it is almost like being married over.
Nothing but the good work we are trying to
accomplish could have persuaded me to stay
away from him so long. I have been hard at
work all winter, and have got the College enterprise
into good shape, and it bids fair to be
a splendid success. If we can only stem the
tide of our financial troubles a year longer, I
think we shall be safe. We think we can get
the college in operation by September, 1893.
If Brother Porterfield will keep our house until
then, or sell it for us, or if we can get the
Omaha property off at half-cost price, we will
be safe. I believe the Lord will put it into the
hearts of our friends to stand by us. When
the college is up, we shall be able to return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
their kindness tenfold. How happy we shall
be, when the college is built, and we have you
and our dear little Tillie with us every winter!
Pray without ceasing, dear Sister Weaver, that
the college may be built, for we are so anxious
to do a good work, and we want to <i>work
together</i>, the remainder of our lives. The Reid
case at Omaha will retard the college enterprise,
for I will have to go there in April; but
we trust in the Lord, since the work we are
doing is for His Cause, and we believe He will
give us success in His own good time.</p>

<p>"We shall be hard pressed, for we are borrowing
money, and indeed will be borrowing until
the college is up, but after that, we hope to
have plenty to live on and give to the Lord.
Mr. Carr and I have keenly felt our financial
embarrassment, but remember we have told no
one but you just how great is that embarrassment;
keep it locked up in your own heart.
Keep your health and strength for Tillie. She
is the special charge God has given you. Keep
your energy for her. Is she taking music lessons&mdash;or
do you think she is still too young?
Bless her heart! how I wish I could kiss her this
minute! Tell Brother Capp to bring you each
<i>Homiletic Review</i>, after he has read it."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>
<p>About this time, J. W. McGarvey, President
of the Bible College of Kentucky University,
wrote: "It gives me great pleasure to learn
that Brother and Sister Carr have undertaken,
in connection with the brethren of Sherman, to
establish a female college of high grade in that
city. Their removal to Texas will not only promote
the educational interests of that State,&mdash;for
which work, Sister Carr has eminent qualifications
and experience,&mdash;but it will add very
materially to its evangelizing force. Brother
Carr has had a great deal of successful experience
as an evangelist, and his skill in organizing
churches for effective work is not inferior to
his presentation of the Gospel. I wish them
abundant success in their undertakings, not
for their own sakes merely, but for the sake of
the cause of truth."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr's reference to money stringency
may be explained by the fact that the payment
of college lots did not fall due until the college
building was actually begun. As our story
advances, the reader must imagine the hundreds
of attempts to find buyers for the lots,
the hundreds of rebuffs, excuses, refusals, which
cannot find place in this work, lest it sink under
melancholy monotony.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>
<p>April 4th, Mrs. Carr wrote from Farmington,
Texas, "I don't want to write to you, I
want to talk to you, face to face. Tell little
Tillie to help you pray for our success in the
college enterprise. Sherman takes 150 lots;
and if we can sell 100 additional outside of
Sherman; the thing is a success. May our
Heavenly Father be with us, and speed the
work of our hearts. If our Springfield property
could be sold, it would be such a help.
Tell Brother Capp if he can sell ten lots for us,
we will thoroughly educate one of his daughters,
board and all, free of charge. Several
preachers here, and one in Kentucky, have
undertaken this, and I believe they will succeed.
If he will undertake this, let me know
at once, and I will send him map of lots, picture
of building, and all necessary information."</p>

<p>To this letter Mr. Carr adds a postscript:
"We are in Grayson County, in the interests
of the college. Mattie has lain down to read,
after we had a talk about you, of the time
which we hope will come, when, the college
built, we shall have a home, and you and Tillie
with us in the Sunny South. I had a visit
from Brother J. D. McClure and his son-in-law
from Iowa&mdash;where I had a vacation on leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
Springfield. I wish you could know these
people. They are the right kind. He wrote
before coming, 'I shall be as proud to see you
as if you were my own brother.' You may be
sure I was proud to see these true men and to
introduce them to Mattie. They are booked
for five lots in the college enterprise. Remember
our address is Sherman, Texas, and letters
will be forwarded us, wherever we may be."</p>

<p>On October 10th, the following from the
Sherman Soliciting Committee to Mrs. Carr,
suggests some of her difficulties: "After a full
discussion of the matter, the Soliciting Committee
decides that it would be inopportune to
try to sell the remainder of the College Park
lots. It is thought best to defer this until
after the November election; and, in fact, the
opinion prevails among the majority of the
Committee that it would be better, if possible,
for you to finish selling your 100 lots, return to
Sherman, report that you have carried out
your part of the agreement, and that if Sherman
does not come up to her part of the agreement,
that you will proceed to go elsewhere
with the college."</p>

<p>Mr. Carr to Mrs. Carr, January 13, 1893:
"What a surprise to receive your card announcing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
that you are in Kansas City and will
go to Springfield before returning to Sherman!
Still it's all right, if you can sell the lots. I
have had a fearful time, I sold only three at
Clarksville. We will have to take off the names
of &mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash;, who say they cannot
take their lots! All in all, I have sold 90 lots.
Dear me! I have done my best, and have lost a
great deal of time&mdash;rain and mud. I think we
can close it up in about two weeks when you
come. Sell all the lots you can, but do not
delay, do not waste time. I don't believe any
lots could be sold in Paris or Bonham. I tried
faithfully. Joshua Burdette, son of Geo. Burdette
of Clarksville, Texas, lives at Eufaula,
Indian Territory. He is a member of the
church and is making money; you might sell
him a lot. Tell those Springfield preachers
Jimmie Pinkerton" (son of our old favorite
professor and doctor) "and John Hardin
and Tom Capp, I say for them to put their
names on your list for a lot each."</p>

<p>In short, one thinks of little but lots, these
days; one dreams of lots; one writes always,
speaks always, of lots. People must learn that
these lots are for sale, they must be persuaded
that the purchase of them is for individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
good, for educational enlargement, for the advancement
of spiritual interests. The Carrs
believe all this. Will others believe?</p>

<p>Fortunately others are found to enter heartily
into the project.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> But, as one might naturally
expect, there is great opposition, which one
always finds as the shadow to bright deeds. It
would seem that no light can shine in the world
without casting the shadow of opposing forces
upon the ground. There are some who treat
the Carrs with rude incivility; will buy no lots,
and will, if possible, persuade others from
buying.</p>

<p>On one occasion, Mrs. Carr was obliged to
walk to the station from a distant farm-house&mdash;do
you know those muddy Texas roads in
the "Black Lands?"&mdash;because the farmer is
opposed to buying the college lots; he watches
her grimly as she makes her way along the
difficult road, with no intention of offering his
horses. We have before us letters written to
Mrs. Carr by members of the church in good
fellowship&mdash;men of recognized standing in their
communities, and who, without doubt believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
themselves to be excellent Christians. But
alas! these letters, in refusing to buy the college
lots, are not, as it would appear, the letters of
gentlemen, so we must pass them by.</p>

<p>These were in truth times of pressing need.
Mrs. Carr often found it best to walk that she
might save the expense of a cab. The Carrs
had just suffered a loss of $12,000 in property
at Omaha. Often Mr. Carr was obliged to go
hungry in his expeditions of lot-selling, and on
his way to hold meetings. There were taxes to
be paid on vacant property, interest to be found
that borrowed money demanded, while traveling
expenses were necessarily large.</p>

<p>"Will you please tell me where I can get a
meal for twenty-five cents?" Mr. Carr inquired
of a stranger in a town whither he had gone to
lecture.</p>

<p>The man indicated a restaurant. Mr. Carr
went away, but soon returned to the stranger,
saying,</p>

<p>"Will you be so kind as to tell me where I
could get the quarter?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the glum response; "at the
bank."</p>

<p>"And," said Mr. Carr, when referring to
the incident, with a twinkle in his gray eye,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
"he wouldn't even promise to come to hear me
lecture."</p>

<p>In the meantime Mrs. Carr was also traveling,
in the prospects of her future college.
"Wherever she went," one writes, "she carried
good cheer and a blessing to that home. There
she would give instruction, impart advice, there
she would help with the sewing, and, with
pleasure, would teach and care for the
children."</p>

<p>But the thought that she should be thus
financially embarrassed and placed in a dependent
position, was most distressing to Mr.
Carr. Yet there was no help for it, until the
lots should have been sold. We do not dwell
upon these days of heartache and suffering, to
inspire remorse in the breast of anyone who
offered obstacles to the great enterprise. We
would, instead, pay a tribute to those who
gave a welcome; who cheered up the way; who,
instead of doubting the outcome, hoped for the
best; who, instead of waiting for ultimate
success, helped in time of need. It is he who
smiles at his open door, who joins his song to
that of the singer along life's highroad, and
reaches out his hand to help, and waves to the
departing traveler his confidence of victory,&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
it is, who finds the world growing better.
For the world is always growing better for him
who makes it better for others. Those who
helped the Carrs with friendship, and with a
participation in their college-plans, cannot be
named in this book; but we should like to think
that those still living might read these lines,
and each take them to himself.</p>

<p>January 30, 1893, Mr. and Mrs. Carr issued
this typewritten manifesto to subscribers for
lots:</p>

<p>"When you purchased one of the Christian
College lots, we promised you that you would
not be called on for the first payment before
September, 1892. Because of Mrs. Carr's protracted
suspension of the work, on account of
sickness, the sale of lots has been, of course,
retarded. We shall be ready, however, for the
distribution of lots by March 1st, 1893, and
write to you at this early date, that you may
have ample time to arrange for making at that
date the <span class="smcap">FIRST PAYMENT</span> ($100). Please make
your draft of $100 payable to Hon. T. J.
Brown and Judge H. O. Head, Trustees, Sherman,
Texas, who will make you a deed to your
lot. If you desire to pay all cash, and it will
be best of course, if you can, send the draft for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
$200 (the full amount) payable to the said
Trustees. We shall begin the college building
by the middle of next March, and open the
first session in September, 1893."</p>

<p>But if the reader supposes that all now
glides smoothly forward, let him read this of
May 20th: "The distribution of the Christian
College lots has been unavoidably postponed
until the first of July next, when it <span class="smcap">WILL POSITIVELY
TAKE PLACE</span> in the court house in
Sherman, Texas, at 2 o'clock p. m.</p>

<div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">O. A. Carr,<br />
M. F. Carr."</span>
</div>

<p>At last the ground is broken for the foundation
of the college building, and Mrs. Carr
proudly walks behind the plow, and guides it in
the making of one long furrow. Can you not
see her marching thus, grasping the handles
with all her strength, her eyes aglow with the
realization that she is digging deeper than a
foundation of stone?</p>

<p>O. A. Bartholomew is called upon to undertake
the construction of the building, July
27th. He shows hesitation and remarks&mdash;while
our heads nod mechanically, <i>Ah, how
true!</i> "I do not know what to say. The
churches for which I have made the completest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
plans, have found the most fault. Especially,
if I did not charge them much!" And we
who have never built churches, yet feel like crying,
Ah, yes, how true!</p>

<p>Let us pass over the months of sleepless
nights, of anxious days. There was one matter
that brought great hindrance to the scheme.
It was currently reported that the college was
merely a private enterprise of the Carrs, like
any other private school; and the Carrs would
reap all its advantages and profits: and that
the claim that it was deeded to the church was
a specious pretense made in order to induce
people to buy lots. These charges were made,
not by the enemies of education and Christianity,
not by unfriendly denominations, but by
the members of the Christian church; in other
words, by the very body to whom the college
was deeded, to be theirs forever.</p>

<p>This accusation had its staunch adherents,
men who for years were ready to argue warmly,
if not dispassionately, in its support. The fact
that it could have been disproved by simply
glancing at the records, seems to have lessened
none of its force. It wrought much delay in
selling the lots, and, after the college was built,
it served to lessen the attendance. Carr-Burdette<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
College was, indeed, a free and loving
gift,&mdash;given, one might almost say, in spite of
the reluctance of the beneficiary, and held in
his possession while he disclaimed its ownership.</p>

<p>It is not our wish to lessen the patient helpfulness
of many of the members of the church.
Had the Carrs worked themselves to death
they could not have disposed of the lots, had
not people been found to buy them. People
there were found, as we have seen, who co-operated
with the Carrs to the extent of their
ability, and many of these were among the
most illustrious of the Texan brotherhood.
But for years, one might find at a general convention,
the spirit of suspicion and hostility to
Carr-Burdette College&mdash;as "Christian College"
was finally named, and, at important committee
meetings, it would be plainly declared that
the college was a private enterprise and did not
belong to the church.</p>

<p>But we will never get our college up at this
rate. Let us pass on to the winter of 1893,
which takes O. A. Carr once more to Kentucky.
Who would ever have thought that the Kentucky
boy of May's Lick, chalking his problems
on his father's barn-door, would, at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
later day, be going up and down his native
State, selling college lots, and looking out for
prospective pupils of his own? These pupils
are for next year. The day for laying the
corner-stone of the college, is to dawn while Mr.
Carr is far away from Sherman.</p>

<p>On December 26th, Mrs. Carr writes to him:
"I hope you will have a happy time with your
kindred. I am very lonely without you; but it
must be thus, until those twenty lots are sold.
Necessity is a stern tyrant. But we have borne
thus far, and we can bear a little longer. How
happy we'll be, when we can be at home together
all the time! The corner-stone will be
laid New Year's Day at 3 p. m. I am dispatching
you tonight to have your message in
your own hand writing, to be read on the occasion,
and it will be deposited in the bowl of the
corner-stone. It is too bad you can't be here.
This sacrifice should make a heart-appealing
chapter in my book. Have your speech here
without fail, in your own hand writing. Your
message in your letter to me is beautiful, and
I'll read that if necessary, but there are other
things in that letter I don't want to go into
the corner-stone. Suppose you send a dispatch,
for fear your speech will not come in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
time. Do this at once. I send this to Maysville,
and a copy to Carmel. A merry Christmas
to all! How I wish I were with you!"</p>

<p>As to the "book" referred to, that, of course,
is the "History of Carr-Burdette College;" the
book which Mrs. Carr intends to write&mdash;after
the college is built, of course; a book which will
tell of almost superhuman struggles, of cruel
sacrifices and, thank God! of words of love and
cheer, and of final peace "in our home, where
we shall live together." But the book was
never written. Here and there among groups
of old letters we find a document superscribed
"Important," or, "For the Book"&mdash;and we
know Mrs. Carr wrote that, with her mind
upon some future day, when she would have
time&mdash;time in her old age, the heat of battle
dying away, and the calm of memory softening
the past&mdash;a time that never came, else <i>this</i>
book would have had no being.</p>

<p>January 10, 1894, Mr. Carr to Mrs. Carr:
"I go to hold a meeting at Vanceburg, Kentucky.
I am sorry I could not be at Sherman
when the corner-stone was laid. Of course, it
was laid right side up, with care; and as my
wife is to see to it, I'm sure it will be well done.
But it is too bad that I have to be away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
causing you to work yourself down, and get
sick. I am devoutly thankful to Sister Hildebrand
for her care of you. Tell her she shall
have her reward, by and by! I suppose the
corner-stone was laid on the 7th&mdash;" sickness
having made New Year's Day impossible. "I
do hope you will excuse me for not sending a
message worthy of the occasion. I wonder
what you did with my poetry? If you planted
it in the rock, I will have to get up something
else for your Book. Look here! What did
you think of that poetry? Perhaps there has
been another delay of corner-stone ceremonies,&mdash;pshaw!
if I could get into the spirit of it, I
could write something, but I am so unsettled
and so put out from not doing anything, that
I can scarcely write a letter, to say nothing of
writing what is to be left as a monument!"</p>

<p>The following, from Mr. Carr, January 24th,
is a fitting trumpet-note with which to close
the discords and harmonies of the college-overture:
"I received a paper to-day&mdash;Picture of
college is fine. Hurrah! Your address is grand&mdash;Just
the thing! You are doing fine work."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>


<p>That was, without a doubt, the
proudest day in Mrs. Carr's life when
she faced the expectant multitude, on
the day of the corner-stone ceremonies,
and told in simple words, the
story of her striving and achievement. It was,
in truth, the day most significant in her history.</p>

<p>She could cast her eyes over that plowed field,
and in fancy see rising before her, the outlines
of the college which she had designed as her
monument. The money was all raised; never
was Carr-Burdette to rest under the shadow
of mortgage, or suspend payments.</p>

<p>Fresh in the minds of her audience were
many instances of plans for the selling of lots
to erect college buildings,&mdash;plans that had resulted
in forced sales, spasmodic flickerings of
uncertain life, and humiliating defeat. She
and her husband had accomplished what well-organized
boards and influential committees
with fleet financial agents, had not been able
to consummate. They had accomplished this,
not because Texas felt a great educational
want,&mdash;a vacuum in the intellectual thermometer,&mdash;but
in spite of the fact that many Texans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
believed they had schools a-plenty. This
they had accomplished, although misunderstood
and misrepresented by different factions;
although it was persistently denied that the
property belonged to the church; and although
the State papers, on more than one occasion,
refused to print an advertisement of the enterprise.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carr did not rehearse these difficulties,
save in general and mild terms. A record of
her sad experiences was placed by her own
hand in the dark recess of the corner-stone;
but we, who are unable to hide our record in so
sacred a receptacle, must be content to lay it
before the public eye, with all good-will, and,
we trust, all fairness. In her address, that
January day of 1894, Mrs. Carr said:</p>

<p>"To sell 250 lots at $200 each and to collect
the money, was the work to be accomplished in
order to secure the college&mdash;a work that demanded
enormous courage and indomitable will
power and persistence. We struck out the
word "fail," and all its derivatives from our
vocabulary, and addressed ourselves to the
task. We traveled in five different States; and,
amid the distraction of the most intense political
excitement and under the pressure of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
severest financial crisis the country has ever experienced
since 1873, we completed the sale of
the lots after nearly two long years of labor,
worry and anxiety inexpressible. The way has
been long and hard, but you have been kind to
us and God has been with us. The corner-stone
of our life-work is laid to-day; we behold
the consummation of our heart's desire, and we
feel generous towards all and profoundly grateful
to our Heavenly Father for the many and
devoted friends that He has given us to cheer
us by their kind words and deeds when our
burden seemed ofttimes greater than we could
bear. The sacrifice that we have made and
the trials and humiliations that we have endured
are too sacred to be told, even in this
paper that shall be hid in the silence and darkness
of the corner-stone, whose peace the
cyclonic onrush of the Twentieth Century may
never disturb. They are known only to our
own hearts and to God. But we count them
all joy and would endure tenfold more if need
be, because we believe that for the Christian
girls who shall be educated here from generation
to generation there shall work out a far
more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.
We are building, not for ourselves, but for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
coming generations of girls. This thought has
been from the beginning our inspiration and
our strength; and it is useless to say that to
donate this college to the Church of Christ in
Texas for the education of the daughters of the
South is the supremest happiness of our united
lives. It is the child of our adoption, and to
its interests we consecrate the best energies of
our remaining years. Of all the glad New
Years this is to me the gladdest. The only
thing that disturbs the fitness and happiness
of the hour is the unavoidable absence in Kentucky
of my husband, who has labored so long
and so faithfully under circumstances the most
painful to "humor his wife (as he expresses it)
in helping her to bring to a successful issue the
pet scheme of her life." But a gladder time is
yet before us&mdash;the Jubilee Opening next September,
1894, of the completed college&mdash;when
it shall be lighted by the faces of happy girls,
and when Mr. Carr will participate in person
as well as in spirit, and nothing will be lacking
to perfect our joy in the crowning work of our
lives. And best of all, the years of blessed work
that shall follow! Oh, I pray that our Heavenly
Father may give us health and strength, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
length of days, and that the fruits of our
labors may be abundant; so</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i2">'That when our summons comes to join</span>
<span class="i2">The innumerable caravan that moves</span>
<span class="i2">To that mysterious realm where each shall take</span>
<span class="i2">His chamber in the silent halls of death,</span>
<span class="i2">We go, not like the quarry-slave at night,</span>
<span class="i2">Scourged to his dungeon; but, sustained and soothed</span>
<span class="i2">By an unfaltering trust, approach our grave</span>
<span class="i2">Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch</span>
<span class="i2">About him and lies down to pleasant dreams.'"</span>
</div>

<p>But was the work now ended? It was only
about to begin; all else had been preparation.
But how different to work in uncertainty, and
to work in confidence!</p>

<p>There were the catalogues to be thought of,
and notices in the papers to be judiciously
given out, and furniture to be bought, and
trees, and shrubbery, and pianos, and charts,
and all things else needful to college life.
Above all, there is the building itself to be
erected.</p>

<p>And, of course, many who have subscribed for
lots do not want to pay for them, when paytime
comes due,&mdash;and are indignant at being
held to their bond, and say bitter things, and
spread unkind rumors. And some have to be
excused from paying interest, else they will pay
nothing; and some move away, one knows not
whither!</p>

<p>"Mrs. O. A. Carr is in the city," says a daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
paper. "Carr-Burdette Christian College at
Sherman will open in September. The college
has been donated to the Christian churches in
the State, but will be open to all denominations.
Mr. and Mrs. Carr are doing much for
the educational interests of Texas, and their
philanthropic devotion to this interest sets an
example which we hope will be emulated."</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;The College is Built at Last.&quot;&mdash;Carr-Burdette.</span>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Carr clips the foregoing and sends it to
the <i>Gospel Advocate</i>, hoping they will reproduce
all, or a part, of the "local".</p>

<p>"My dear Sister," says the <i>Gospel Advocate</i>&mdash;it
is in August of the corner-stone year, "it
is our settled policy not to advertise one school
more than another. We do not see any reason
why we should advertise the Carr-Burdette
College any more than the Add Rann College.
There are a number of good schools controlled
by the brethren, to whom we have never given
free advertisement. Yours truly and fraternally&mdash;"
Very fraternally, without doubt.
So Mrs. Carr may be in our city as often as
she pleases, and she and her husband do all
they can, for a dozen colleges, but we mustn't
mention the fact; such is our policy!</p>

<p>John A. Brooks, pastor of the Christian
church at Memphis, writes to Mr. and Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
Carr: "I am pleased to see that you are about
to open a female school in Sherman. I know
your education and character are such as to
commend you to the public as most competent
teachers. Most heartily I wish you both a
successful voyage on the sea of life."</p>

<p>This from Palestine, Texas, July 13th, to
Mrs. Carr, is a voice from the camp of misconception:
"I have read your letter with much
interest. I accord to you the purest and best
motives in your work, and believe you to be a
noble woman. But it is reported, on good
authority, that you and Brother Carr are not
in sympathy with our work in Texas, the
United States and abroad. I shall not enter
the lists against you and your work, however&mdash;I
shall attend to my own business, which will
keep me busy enough * * * Fraternally
yours&mdash;"</p>

<p>That word "Fraternally," which we find
closing so many bitter and discourteous letters,
seems to be used as a parting blow. They all
write "Fraternally"&mdash;that stereotyped phrase
of a stereotyped brotherhood! But the present
biographer feels indeed fraternally toward
these indignant and suspicious and mistaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
letter-writers, and shall prove it by reproducing
none of their letters.</p>

<p>For these writers who were so warmly
"fraternal" did not understand, and seemingly
would not understand, that the Carrs had
deeded the college and the extensive grounds
to the Church; that the Carrs furnished the
buildings throughout, at their own expense, to
present them to the Church fully and beautifully
equipped; that the Carrs had insured,
and would keep insured, the buildings, not for
themselves, but for the Church; that they did
not, and never would, receive a penny of money-contributions
from anyone; and that this Carr-Burdette
College, this monument to Mrs. Carr,
was given to the Church as the most priceless
gift in her possession, to the cause dearest to
her heart.</p>

<p>In the meantime, college-work did not wholly
absorb the life of this busy woman. Here
comes a letter from the Christian Woman's
Board of Missions in Missouri; the state-secretary,
at this time, is Mrs. Elizabeth Bantz.
Mrs. Bantz writes:</p>

<p>"This year marks the twenty-fifth year of
the C. W. B. M. in Missouri&mdash;1894. My
board has authorized me to issue an historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
sketch of the work. We are publishing the
faces of many of those who served us officially.
We want your picture for this book. Please,
my dear sister, send me a half-tone cut, as soon
as possible."</p>

<p>Mrs. A. B. Jones of Liberty, Mo., seconds
the request: "I have been asked to write an
historical sketch of our C. W. B. M. for a book
which our state secretary is preparing for our
25th anniversary. We want our state officers
from the time of our organization. Will you
kindly send a photo, or cut, to Mrs. Bantz at
St. Louis? I would be so glad to have a picture
of yourself and Brother Carr. Both of
you are lovingly remembered by us."</p>

<p>Now that the college is built at last, and Mr.
and Mrs. Carr have assumed its management,
the story of their lives enters the peaceful channel
of daily service together.</p>

<p>A few events of distinction stand out from
among the minor affairs of fourteen years.
The incessant work in the school room, the
canvassing tours during vacations,&mdash;involving
lectures with the stereopticon,&mdash;the correspondence
with new pupils, old pupils and prospective
pupils, the worrying over misunderstandings
and misrepresentations; the struggle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
against prejudice, and jealousy; the sweet companionship
with each other, and with congenial
friends&mdash;all this is the story of daily living, that
does not belong to the world of books.</p>

<p>Let the reader imagine the interlinked events
of these fourteen years&mdash;the fourteen years that
followed the accomplishment of Mrs. Carr's life-work.
The honors bestowed upon her and
her girls at the Confederate Reunion at New
Orleans, and at the World's Fair at St. Louis,
may be found fully described in the great daily
papers of those days. The mass of printed
programs that lie before me tell of brilliant success
before the footlights&mdash;and hint at long
hours of nerve-racking rehearsals. And here
are confessions of school-girls who have done
wrong, and who ask to be forgiven; and other
letters which wound cruelly and do not ask for
pardon. But shall we not forgive all? And
how can we forgive, if we do not forget?</p>

<p>Upon my table lies documents from disobedient
pupils of Carr-Burdette College, ungrateful
pupils, narrow-minded pupils, and parents
naturally championing the cause of their
daughters&mdash;in which, all these stand self-accused.
Here is one who has discovered
how unjust were charges she had made against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
the Carrs&mdash;but not until she had spread those
reports to willing ears. And here is one who
asks with tears that she may be forgiven; but
who laments that the harm she has done can
never be overcome.</p>

<p>But what of it all, now! I should not mention
these things if it were not for this: that
the evil reports live in some minds and, no
doubt, are handed down to strangers. Here
are the refutations to several such reports, but
we push them aside. Can falsehood wound
beyond the grave?</p>

<p>Nor would we expose anyone to shame by
bringing her name upon the printed page, with
quotations of her own rash words. There is
no punishment for a malicious nature so terrible
as the vengeance of its own malice which
reacts upon itself, dwarfing, embittering, deadening
the higher capabilities of the soul that
harbors it. He who took the snake to his
warm hearth to nourish it to life, is not he who
suffers from the ingratitude of a friend, but
rather he who admits hate to warm it in his
own bosom; for it wounds him, first of all.</p>

<p>Fourteen years of labor in the work Mrs.
Carr loved best, amid surroundings best
adapted to call forth one's greatest capabilities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
and then&mdash;the last journey. The school year
of 1907-8 had opened prosperously. September
passed, and in the warmth of its haze,
and in the tender blue of its Texan sky, there
was no hint that its sister-month would bring
the chill of death.</p>

<p>It was on the thirty-first of October that
there came the summons of which she had
spoken in her dedicatory speech. Not, indeed,
as a quarry slave, scourged to his dungeon, did
she go to meet that call, but rather as one who
had followed her Lord across the seas, who had
dwelt with him in many lands, and who was
now to abide with Him forever.</p>

<p>He who was left behind, dwells in the lofty
halls her wisdom and her love fashioned out of
brick and stone. The great work of her life is
continued by President O. A. Carr, and when
one visits that "College Beautiful," that
"College Home," tapestries and statuary, pictures
and mosaics, engravings and flowers&mdash;all
seem instinct with the presence of Mrs. Carr.</p>

<p>One passes through spacious reception-rooms
and ample halls, into parlors of refined and exquisite
workmanship. Yonder is the winding
stairway, with its "Cosy Nook" behind the
ferns. Here is the library with its cheerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
hearth. Nothing is to be seen to suggest
Latin and Geometry! It is, first of all, a home
for young ladies.</p>

<p>But when we are shown the mystic way that
leads to schoolrooms, we find them stript, as it
were, for service. Here is little or no adornment.
They are placed before us in stern reality&mdash;desk
and blackboard and floor&mdash;with no
pretense that knowledge walks on velvet carpets.
In this wing, we find ourselves indeed in
a school; and we feel instinctively that if we do
not immediately fall to, at some difficult textbook,
we have no business here, and should be
sent home to our parents.</p>

<p>And that is just what Mrs. Carr would have
done for us. Education had always for her,
meant something serious, something life-long,
something to become an integral part of one's
character. First, Carr-Burdette College is to be
a <i>home</i> in which young ladies are to be taught
conduct and hygiene; but it is a <i>College</i> Home,
where study is not play, any more than play is
study. We cannot determine where we feel
Mrs. Carr's influence stronger&mdash;whether in
these unadorned schoolrooms, or in the luxurious
parlors. Taken together, they typify the
extremes of her character. She sought to build<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
in every soul that came under her moulding
touch, the firm foundation of eternal truth;
and upon this foundation to erect a structure
traced with all the beauty of eternal love.</p>

<h3>By O. A. Carr.</h3>


<h5>(Page 31.)</h5>

<p>Our mother made our clothes from the same piece, which,
for many years, was her own weaving; and our resemblance
was such in childhood that many thought we were twins.
For sixteen years we were together day and night&mdash;in the
field, in the school-room, in the home. "Bud and Ol.,"
our familiar names, were pronounced together, and the presence
of one suggested the other. Our separation came when
I said good-by to go to Kentucky University, and then to
the other side of the earth. I can even now recall my feelings
when I would go into Fitzroy Gardens, Melbourne, Australia,
where, alone, I would read Owen's letters over and
over. Though himself not a preacher, he came as near as
any one I ever knew to an identification of his life with the
lives of those who preach the word.</p>

<p>After my return from Australia it was our happiness to go
together to a church composed of many whom I baptized
when I began preaching forty-five years ago, some of them
our relatives. The building was within a mile of where we
were born, and near the site of the first school-house we ever
entered. There were the boys and girls with whom we
played in childhood, heads of families now. Such an audience
was an inspiration to me, and especially the presence
of "Bud." I ever felt that I could preach better when he was
hearing. We went over the familiar roads planning a meeting
to be held when the weather would permit, and I thought
this happiness would be mine, but alas! there came the telegram:
"Bud is very sick, come at once." We all came to
him, except one brother who was far away. There were the
chairs my mother used, my father's desk, the little chair in
which I sat in earliest childhood, and the pictures on the wall
of those whom my brother loved. There, amid all to remind
me of early days, I took my seat beside him with the
sad duty on me to report to the physician his pulse and fever
day and night. What was revealed by his tearful eyes fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2a" id="Page_2a">[2]</a></span>
upon us can never be put in a book; but when the physician
told him he must die, he simply said "I am ready."</p>

<p>With the exception of a short sojourn in Missouri and Illinois
Owen spent his life in Kentucky, at May's Lick, also at
Lexington, Maysville and Mt. Carmel. The call for a young
man who neither blasphemed nor drank secured for him his
first business engagement at Lexington. He was engaged in
Maysville many years, and he spent his earnings in helping
our afflicted parents; and from the needy he never turned
away. After the death of father and mother, Owen made
his home with his sister, Mary E. Goddard, near Mt. Carmel,
whence he was called to go up higher, Thursday, January
14, 1902.</p>

<p>Owen Carr was a Christian. His life was very quiet, but
useful. His faith was simple, his convictions were strong
and he was true to them. To maintain what he held to be
truth I believe he would have laid down his life. Yes, he did
this in effect, toiling for the good of others, bearing heavy
burdens of suffering, fulfilling his mission to the family, in
the community, in the church. How can I speak his praise?
Does he know, now, how we all loved him? No words
could ever tell it.</p>

<p>A companion wrote: "Though our association was not
long at any one time, yet he was so transparent and
companionable that in a short time I knew Owen Carr well.
He was one of the few men in the world that I really loved
ardently; and I have his obituary on the 'Treasure page' of
my little scrap book. He was the divinest and sweetest impersonation
of unostentatious unselfishness and of transparent
honesty and integrity that I ever knew among men.</p>

<h4>IN MEMORY OF THE NOBLE.</h4>

<h5>(Page 46.)</h5>

<p>"Not of the blood," though they were Englishmen: "nor
of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man", and yet the
Myalls, Eneas, Jonas, George and Edward, stand in memory
as <span class="smcap">NOBLE MEN</span>. In the days of their activity, their motto
seemed to be: "We will do more than any others". Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3a" id="Page_3a">[3]</a></span>
these four men two&mdash;Jonas at May's Lick, and Edward, at
Maysville, Kentucky&mdash;still live, and they are my witnesses.
Eneas and Jonas Myall were blacksmiths; and they shod one
hundred mules in a day, at a time when mules were driven
overland to market! Energy, perseverance, generosity characterized
these men&mdash;each in his own way.&mdash;Remembrance of
them has been with me and has been presented to the young
men in many lands and on both sides of the earth.</p>

<p>Of Eneas Myall Longfellow's words in "<span class="smcap">THE VILLAGE
BLACKSMITH</span>" are true in almost every line.</p>

<p>If money was to be raised for benevolent purposes Eneas
Myall was the one to secure it; for he headed the list with a
liberal offering, and while others did the talking, he did the
work. He was more eloquent in deed than they were in
speech: hence May's Lick church was in the lead of all
churches in that part of the country in expenditures at home
and abroad. As a deacon in the church he was well nigh
perfection. I have never seen a better.</p>

<p>His constancy made him great in usefulness. For more
than sixty years he led the songs in the May's Lick church.
For a period of twenty years he was never known to be absent
from the meeting on Lord's day morning and night and
the Wednesday night prayer meeting except on one occasion,
when he went to Paris to see his sick brother. His best singing
was done, as it seems, on occasions when the boy, his
protege, was in the pulpit. Such singing is seldom heard
now-a-days as was heard when these men, Ed., George, Jonas
and Eneas Myall sang together with Eneas to lead. There
was only one occasion, as I remember, when Eneas Myall
could not sing, and that was the morning when my father
came forward to confess his faith in Jesus. He wept for
joy; but could not talk&mdash;could not sing. The circumstances
seemed to me to magnify his sincerity; for it was just at the
close of the war. Eneas Myall was of strong prejudice, and
he was opposed to my father politically, but the welcome he
extended seemed to say: we differ out yonder in the world
where political troubles are, and war rages; but here, in the
church, there is peace, and we have fellowship. When I
took my father down into the water to bury him with Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4a" id="Page_4a">[4]</a></span>
in baptism, Eneas Myall had recovered himself so as to sing:</p>

<div class="center">
"How happy are they, who their Savior obey."</div>

<p>It is not strange that a man possessed of such firmness,
such perseverance and such energy should become wealthy.
His earnings increased: He sowed with an unsparing hand,
and he reaped bountifully. Wealth did not make him proud
nor dry up the fountain of his generosity. He seemed never
so happy as when he was dividing what he possessed with
his friends. When he and his good wife, "aunt Sallie"
would spread the banquet, and he would gather all the
preachers he could find and those who loved such company
to his house, and around the table where he presided, what a
feast for body and soul was there! What preacher who has
ever been at May's Lick does not remember Eneas Myall and
his family? He has gone; and shall we ever see his like
again? Before him across the silent river had passed his
faithful wife and the elders of the May's Lick church, as
nearly models, as mortals could be expected to be, of what
the Scriptures say of bishops, elders, pastors. What a church
that was! over which Aaron Mitchell, Waller Small and Benjamin
James presided, and taught by precept and example
and led and protected, in those days when Walter Scott did
the preaching and Eneas Myall led in song!</p>


<h4>MY SHEEP.</h4>

<h5>(Page 272.)</h5>

<p>"A sheep can never become a goat!" True of the woolly
quadruped but this fact is no reply to my sermon; for the
Savior was not talking about animals. He meant people
when he said "My sheep hear my voice and follow me".
That is what sheep (animals) do; hence people who hear his
voice and follow him he calls his sheep; and says "they shall
never perish". Who? His sheep; that is, people who hear
his voice and follow him. If they should cease to hear his
voice and follow they would cease to be his sheep and the
Savior did not say of such, "they shall never perish."</p>

<p>But were they his sheep before they heard his voice.</p>

<p>They might have been called "sheep" on account of some
other resemblance, such as proneness to wander away, need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5a" id="Page_5a">[5]</a></span>
of guidance, of protection; but for these reasons it would not
be true of them that "they shall never perish". It is certain
that they would perish; hence the Great Good Shepherd
came and called them home, saved and protected them.</p>

<p>If you say they were his sheep because he died for them&mdash;"laid
down his life for the sheep", I answer: He called them
his sheep before he laid down his life for them; and when
he died it was not for them alone but "he died for all".</p>

<p>The truth is that the characteristic of sheep, to hear and
follow, is possessed by all mankind; and whose sheep they
are depends upon whose voice they hear and whom they follow.
They are not the Savior's sheep unless they hear <span class="smcap">HIS</span>
voice and follow <span class="smcap">HIM</span>. When persons do turn away from
other voices and give heed to <span class="smcap">HIS</span> they become <span class="smcap">HIS</span> sheep.
Would you say, this is not true, and give as a reason, "a
<span class="smcap">GOAT</span> can never become a <span class="smcap">SHEEP</span>?" As well say this as to
say "a sheep can never become a goat" as a proof that a believer
may not, can not, cease to be a believer.</p>

<p>The one expression is fate fixed as fatally as is the other;
and neither of them contains any Scripture idea.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The <span class="smcap">Trial</span> was unique. The purpose was to determine
whether I should be permitted to use their baptistry; and this
depended on whether I was sound on what they called "the
design of the ordinance." There were the officers of the
Baptist Church to hear and a lawyer to ask questions. He
put them in such a way that each question could be answered
by simply quoting the Scripture; and that was happy; it was
right, too, whether he intended it or not: "What do you
believe baptism is for&mdash;what purpose has it?" Answer.
"Repent and be baptized&mdash;in the name of Jesus the Christ
<span class="smcap">FOR</span> the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of
the Holy Spirit." Acts 2:38.</p>

<p>"Do you regard it as a saving ordinance?" Answer&mdash;"He
that believeth and is baptized shall be saved." Mark
16:15-16.</p>

<p>"Yes, we believe that: of course, we believe the Scriptures,
but what do <span class="smcap">YOU THINK</span>? Do you think a person cannot be
saved without baptism?" Answer&mdash;"I think just what the
Savior says: 'He that believeth and is baptized shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6a" id="Page_6a">[6]</a></span>
saved.' It is not my privilege to <span class="smcap">THINK</span> anything except
what the Savior said, and what his Apostles preached and
practiced. Aside from this I have no ability to think; for I
have nothing to think about." "Well, our Savior says:
'he that believeth not shall be damned' and he does not say he
that believeth not and is not baptized shall be damned." "Does
not this show that baptism is not necessary to salvation, that
it is not a saving ordinance?" Answer&mdash;"Baptism is not
named in that clause, hence, we cannot think what that
clause says and have baptism in mind at all; since it is not
there. The way to be saved, Jesus says, is: 'he that believeth
and is baptized shall be saved;' but the way to be
damned, he says, is, 'he that believeth not shall be damned.'
I think just what the Savior says on the subject of
<span class="smcap">DAMNATION</span>; and I think just what he says on the subject of
<span class="smcap">SALVATION</span>."</p>

<p>Then Brother Jones, a Baptist, addressed the meeting in
substance thus: "Brethren, I have heard every sermon our
young brother has preached in Hobart, and I have found no
fault with it. He says just what the Scriptures say, and
surely you cannot refuse that. You heard the sermon on,
'What must I do to be saved'"? Then Brother Jones gave
an outline of that sermon&mdash;the first I had ever heard that I
understood&mdash;heard it from W. T. Moore at May's Lick, Ky.,
and from him I learned how to preach it. Thereupon a
good man of the company of Baptists arose and said: "I
would rather give up my life than countenance <span class="smcap">FREE-GRACE</span>
preaching." I did not want him to give up his life, and so
the interview ended with my resolution not to use the baptistry;
I would use the public baths instead.</p>


<h4>MRS. CARR AND A LITTLE BOY&mdash;THIRTY-FIVE<br />
YEARS AGO.</h4>

<h5>(Page 198.)</h5>

<p>A letter to be read between the lines. "Melbourne, Australia,
September 5, 1909."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Brother Carr</span>:</p>

<p>"Father wishes me to express to you how very sorry he
was to hear of Mrs. Carr's death, and how deeply he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7a" id="Page_7a">[7]</a></span>
moved by the touching references to and description of her
beautiful life and character. She, indeed, was a wonderful
woman, and must be sorely missed by many. It must be a
terrible blank in your home and we deeply feel for you.
Father felt it very much and very often spoke of her. Indeed,
I felt it too. My mind goes back to my school days
when my sister, Eliza (now gone many years) and I attended
Mrs. Carr's school in Melbourne. I was then but a little fellow&mdash;about
eleven years of age&mdash;(I am now forty-five and
have three children.) It was a school for young ladies, but
four of us boys were allowed to go&mdash;George Thomson,
Willie Robinson, Willie Church and myself&mdash;and many a
heart ache, I think, we boys gave Mrs. Carr. I can remember
that Mrs. Carr put me in a room by myself for fighting
Willie Church. I was in terrible disgrace that day; and I
remember you came into the room and asked me what I had
been doing. I told you I had been fighting Willie Church;
for which you gave me to understand how naughty it was to
fight. Then, I think, you were sorry for me, and said:
'Never mind Nat., we will have some fun,' which we did;
and in the midst of it all Mrs. Carr came in and we both
got in for it. The poor dear lady was doing what she
thought best for me, and instead of punishment I was having
a good time, with you. However, she was always very,
very kind. I do not know that during my young life anyone
so impressed me as the dear soul that has gone from us
all; and I see by the book you sent us that I am not alone
in this respect.</p>

<p>"The Church at Lygon Street is still to the fore. What delight
it would give us all in Melbourne if you could manage
to pay us a visit! Would it be possible for you to do so?
You know the distance now is not so great as when you were
here. The trip would do you good; and you could stay at
my house (and we would have some fun.) The fine, grand
steamers now running out to Australia should tempt you, and
what a pleasure it would give us all to know that you were
coming&mdash;won't you come?</p>

<div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Nat. Haddow.</span>"</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8a" id="Page_8a">[8]</a></span></p>


<h4>"AVOID ALL OFFENSE."</h4>

<h5>(Page 186.)</h5>

<p>The admonition, so impressive then, and needed always,
caused the revision of many a manuscript from that time on.
"That which offends will never convince." But then, when
one's position is assailed, the very assault is considered an
offense: such is human nature. Few are sufficiently civilized
to discuss religious differences and at the same time "avoid
all offense;" for each one holds his religious position as
sacred, whereas, it is sacred only when it is true, when it is
divine.</p>

<p>The Rev. James Ballantyne, a prominent preacher in Melbourne,
had issued a tract. It was no offense for him so to
do: it was right&mdash;even noble from his view of it. But did
he present the truth? was the question, and it is the question
even now, and ought to be inquired into by everyone. To
help in this it was resolved that a <span class="smcap">REPLY</span> be issued. To
"avoid all offense" Mrs. Carr was requested to go over the
manuscript word by word. What she approved it is hoped
will not be an "offense" to the reader. The language of the
author was quoted, his very words, and the reply followed
each paragraph, thus:</p>

<div class="center">"BAPTISM"&mdash;"ITS ORIGIN."</div>

<p>"It is not of man, but of God. Jesus Christ himself instituted
it. We find it in the apostolic commission, 'Go ye
therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in (into) the
name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.'"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">True.</span></p>

<div class="center">"ITS DESIGN."</div>

<p>"It represents and seals the union of the soul with Christ.
It is the pledge that all covenant blessings will be bestowed.
It is the visible sign of our engagement to be Christ's, by receiving
him in faith, and laying ourselves on the altar of his
service. It is our initiation into the membership of the visible
Church. It is the badge of our public Christian profession,
proclaiming our separation from the world and our
union with all who bear the name of Jesus."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The above is in substance, what the presbyterian
Confession of Faith says, instead of what the Bible</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9a" id="Page_9a">[9]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">says is the design of Baptism. Whoever read in the
Bible that Baptism is a sign or a seal, or a symbol
of anything? Paul says, "Ye were sealed with the
Holy Spirit," Eph. 1:13 and 4:30. The Rev. Ballantyne
says, BAPTISM is the seal. The object of his
tract, as stated in his preface was to utter a warning
word to the young, not to let feeling take the
precedence of enlightened conviction, and not to
make TOO MUCH of Baptism. And this is the way
he begins: By putting Baptism in the place of the
Holy Spirit, and by making Baptism seal the union
of the soul with Christ. Remember this: "Ye
ardent and impulsive minds" what saith the scripture
on the design of Baptism, "Thus it becometh us
to fulfill all righteousness," Mat. 3:15; "He that
believeth and is baptized shall be saved," Mark
16:16; "Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus
the Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall
receive the gift of the Holy Spirit," Acts 2:38; "As
many of you as have been baptized into Christ have
put on Christ," Gal. 3:27. Baptism is a Bible theme,
And why not write about it in Bible language?</span></p>

<p>"The words do not declare that Faith must go before
Baptism. The Greek word translated <span class="smcap">BAPTIZED</span> is baptistheis.
The proper meaning of this is, <span class="smcap">HAVING BEEN
BAPTIZED</span>. Anyone who knows the parts of the Greek verb
knows this. The passage, then, reads thus: 'He that believeth,
having been baptized, shall be saved.' So then,
after all, the passage is just as favorable to infant baptism
as any passage could be."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baptistheis means having been baptized. This is
STRICTLY TRUE. It is also strictly true that
"Pisteusas" is the first aorist participle, and literally
means HAVING BELIEVED. "Anyone who knows
the parts of the Greek verb knows this." The passage,</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10a" id="Page_10a">[10]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">then, reads thus: "He having believed, and
having been baptized shall be saved." So, then,
after all, the passage is just as</span> UNSUITABLE TO
INFANT BAPTISM AS ANY PASSAGE COULD BE.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h4>FROM THE ALUMNAE.</h4>

<p>How often do we recall the mornings dear Mrs. Carr
called us into the study hall, or kept us in the dining room
to give us those sweet, motherly 'little talks.' How often
her words come to us as we see her standing there among us,
and, in her gentle, tactful way, a way which belonged only
to her, telling us and advising us about those little things
which play such important part in the formation of habits
and character.</p>

<p>Well do we all remember the little talk about the dirt's
being swept into the corner, or left behind the door; how
that in time such habits would tell upon our characters; that
a neatly kept room was but an expression of a girl's inner
self.</p>

<p>Her precious words we treasure in our hearts and value beyond
all price. How often have we heard her say: "My
dear girls, this I say for your good. It may be hard for you
to receive it, and you may not know now the value of it; but
you will know in after life." And then would follow those
talks about decorum. "Think nothing, do nothing that you
would be ashamed for your father and mother to know.
Write nothing to your intimate friend that would not bear
the light. Admit nothing here into your college home that
would defile. Carr-Burdette College is the child of my brain
and heart, dedicated to you. Our home is our castle, and
let us guard it sacredly. Character is everything in a young
lady's life; knowledge is good, but the wisdom which is from
above is best. I know that some of you girls think I am exacting,
think that I am too strict; but you will know hereafter
that your best friend is the one who tells you kindly of
your faults and helps you to correct them; and you will be
grateful after awhile for having given heed to many things
that you do not like now. You will say in your hearts:
'I see now that Mrs. Carr was right, and I am glad she said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11a" id="Page_11a">[11]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">NO</span> to many of my wishes and warned me against so many
little things that tempted me.' I would deny you nothing
you want except those things that I think will injure you. I
am sleepless at night, thinking of you, planning for your
good, how I can best discharge the weighty responsibility
that is on me."</p>

<p>She was happiest when she knew she was pleasing us,
would join in our merry-making, and laugh aloud at our
pranks. To reward us was her delight. What happy talks
she made when she bestowed medals and honors! Talks,
sparkling with wit and glowing with love and enthusiasm, on
that last night of the session before we all went home. She
is on the rostrum, the medals in their cases are on the stand;
she takes them up, displays them to the audience, one by one,
and talks about each, its meaning, what it is for, talks to the
audience about the girl who is to receive it and who could
ever equal her grace of diction and whole-souled sympathy?
How she kept the audience in suspense, in excitement; how
she amused all by her wit, and then, with tearful joy, pinned
the medal on the girl whom she called to the rostrum to
receive it. Holding up the house-keeper's medal, she would
say to the audience: "This medal I esteem the best of all;
the best house-keeper is to be the most honored. To be
neat, to be orderly, to show ability to keep a home, to mind
the little things that make for neatness, to sweep in the
corners, to be tasteful&mdash;all this is to be lovely in conduct;
and, remember, that all honors of every kind bestowed by
Carr-Burdette College have this meaning namely, every
medal, every diploma is hedged about by conduct."</p>

<h4>TO MATTIE'S MEMORY.</h4>

<h5>[From a letter written by O. A. Carr.]</h5>

<p>"Carr-Burdette College, Sherman, Texas, is the monument
to the memory of my dear departed wife. She gave
the last thirteen years of her life to the college. I feel that
she literally sacrificed her life in the accomplishment of her
high purpose; for I know she toiled beyond her strength,
forgetful of self. She conceived of building the college as a
Home and School for young women, and of how the funds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12a" id="Page_12a">[12]</a></span>
were to be secured. She planned the building, which was
erected under her immediate supervision, and there is not an
idea in it that is not hers. She devised and toiled to within
a few days of her death, and expended all earnings on the
college, that she might attain her ideal.</p>

<p>According to her heart's desire that the college should
never suspend its work, and that her purposes may be carried
out as nearly as possible, I, with the assistance of able and
devoted teachers, continue the struggle. I can not do the
work my dear wife did; nor do I think that any one else
could do what she has been doing all these years; but an
honest effort will be made to accomplish her purpose&mdash;that
Carr-Burdette College may continue to be her <span class="smcap">IDEAL</span>, as it is
now her <span class="smcap">MONUMENT</span>.</p>

<p>Saturday, October 26, 1907, on her return from shopping
with some of the students, I offered to assist Mattie with the
writing. She said: "I am not able to think now; I must
rest." The next day she was unable to rise. The physician
pronounced the trouble lagrippe, and he assured me, even
at noon, Thursday, that she would recover. Alas! at 7:30
p. m. the same day, death came. There was no symptom
of suffering. She seemed to be sleeping.</p>

<p>The loving hands of students and teachers and kind friends
arranged all for the funeral&mdash;the first public assembly held in
the college over which she did not preside and direct in detail.
Her lifeless body lay in her own beautiful college parlor, where
the funeral was conducted by Brother J. H. Fuller and Brother
A. O. Riall assisted by Brother R. D. Smith, and Dr. Clyce,
President of Austin College. Mattie told me years ago that
she wished Brother Graham, with whom she was associated
at Hamilton College, and Brother McGarvey, to preach her
funeral; but Brother Graham had gone where there are no
funerals, and Brother McGarvey could not be here. The
students in a line of march descended the stairway, preceded
by a young girl in white, who bore their beautiful floral
offering. They stood on either side of the casket and sang
(1) "Some Day", (2) "Going Home", (3) "My Savior
First of All", (4) "I Am Only Waiting Here", (5) "Sweet
By and By."</p>

<p>One who knew Mattie well wrote me years ago, saying,
"I know of no one who can show a more valid claim than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13a" id="Page_13a">[13]</a></span>
yourself to have a living commentary on the last chapter of
Proverbs". That chapter was read from the twelfth verse to
the conclusion, by Brother Smith, and Brother Fuller chose
as the text for his beautiful, hopeful discourse, "The gift of
God is eternal life, through our Lord Jesus the Christ".</p>

<p>For nearly forty years Mattie and I have toiled together.
She took responsibility, financial and domestic from me,
and bore it herself. I trusted to her judgment, and felt that
all was well when she approved. And now, at night, I sit
alone where we used to sit together. I look around to see
her, but see only her empty chair."</p>

Theological puzzles: Oliver presented the points in that first sermon
he ever heard that he understood, and to him the Scripture statements
were plain: Anthony, true son of "Calvin", dwelt on the
"decrees". These boys were going to be taught, and Anthony
seemed willing that the "Spirit should guide him into all truth" provided
it did not make a Campbellite of him; for he knew that was
wrong religion. The count stood&mdash;three against one, and in boy

read them to her. I thought of her "CHILDREN," the girls she had
taught. We were seated in her private parlor; and her attention was
fixed from the first stanza: "Shedding sunshine of love on my face."
The reading ended, she threw herself on the bed and wept aloud.
Her feelings, when fully aroused, were paroxysms of joy or grief; and
now the two alternated as memory of her first school at Lancaster,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Just then, it seemed that every one on the ship "cared": That
drunken, card-playing priest proposed to say "mass for the poor
boy's soul"; but Captain Myles said: "None of your foolishness
here". I could not escape the thought that he would have "read
mass", if it had been in the Prayer-book, whether foolishness or not;
for the ship's Captain is ordained to read the church service, or to
appoint some one to read it. That desire to do something, springing
from a feeling of helplessness and grief seems natural to mortals and
cries out most pitilessly when faith is absent. I doubt not it was as
sincere as any prayer ever uttered when Luther wanted to "say mass
for the soul" of his mother. I had seen the poor boy cuffed about
deck, driven to his hard task, beaten with a broom, and had remonstrated
in vain. Between the priest with his rollicking ditties, gambling
and drunkenness and the boy there was a great gulf fixed on
that ship. "No association with second-class passengers" was the
edict; and was not the priest first-class? and the boy, what was he?
He had hidden himself among the boxes in the ship's hold at Liverpool
to be taken any where, perhaps, out of the world, and so it
was. That boy, that scene, what led to it and what followed, Mrs.
Carr never forgot&mdash;"A neglected one, a prodigal, it may have been,
but still a human; he needed something other than sacerdotal robes
to show him that you are the servants of the Most High." Yes, she
"cared" and so do I, even to this day.</p>

seeking work and found it at May's Lick, Kentucky, Martin Zelius
stood in the streets of Melbourne, wondering to what he should turn
his hand. He turned his eye and saw across the street a flaming
placard: "Evangelist from America, H. S. Earl, will preach in St.
George's Hall," etc. "No where to go," he thought to himself, "I will
go hear that man." He was charmed with what he heard, and soon
became obedient to the faith. He entered upon a business life in
which his success was marvelous: everything he touched seemed to
turn to gold. Whole-souled, enthusiastic, he stood before the
church and asked the privilege of sending from his own earnings the
money to pay the expenses of the evangelists from America. One
night, when he had come from church he learned that a brother was
aggrieved at him: he hired a "cab", drove across the city to that
Brother's home, called him from his bed out to talk with him alone,
and broached the matter in such a way that the Brother said: "O, it
was a trifle, I should not have mentioned; I am ashamed of myself
because I did. Is it possible that you have come all this distance to
talk about that?" "Why, yes," said Martin Zelius, "our Savior said,
'if thou bring thy gift to the altar and there remember that thy
Brother hath aught against thee, leave there thy gift; go be reconciled
to thy Brother, and then come and offer thy gift.' I could not pray
to-night until I came to see you, and know what I had done to offend
you." "Well, I always thought a great deal of you, but more now
than ever." Forgiven and happy he goes home, at peace with all the
world.</p>

<p>His wife, fit companion for such a man, of meek and quiet spirit,
entered into fullest sympathy with Mrs. Carr, understood her, knew
her and loved her. She entreated Mrs. Carr to visit her daughter in
California and arrangements were made to do so, to start in two
weeks (in November, 1907); but in five days she had gone to the eternal
home.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Alexander T. Magarey and Vaney J. Magarey were sons of Thomas
Magarey, M. P., of South Australia. They made their home with us
while attending the University of Melbourne. Two more congenial
spirits I never met; nor better students. Then, too, they were Christians
from very love of the Savior, and delighted in the truths of the
Gospel. They were very intelligent in the Scriptures. After my return
from Australia Alex. visited me in Kentucky. It was my delight
to take him among my kindred; for he and his brother seemed to
me like one of my own family, and to present him to the Brethren
as a specimen of what sort could be found in Australia. The memory
of him, his father, brother and the Magarey family is very precious.
Alex. would have me take him to see the mother of Brother Be. sley
who went to Australia, came home an invalid and died of consumption:
he must weep with that mother and see the grave of that young
man: he must see those&mdash;teachers and preachers&mdash;of whom he had
read; he wanted to take them all by the hand, and such a hand
grasp as he gave was remembered. We were sitting together in the
Main Street Church in Louisville during the State Meeting in 1880,
when T. P. Haley asked if any knew of rich men's sons who are
preachers of the Gospel. Only two were known&mdash;T. M. Arnold of
Covington, Kentucky, and Alex. Magarey. On one occasion his
horse, which no one drove but him, took us in a buggy from his
father's home to a church near Adelaide where Alex. preached. The
people there were poor, and he would minister to them&mdash;"preach the
gospel to the poor". He taught them to give. A woman who had
no money had gathered the wild flowers&mdash;her offering&mdash;better than
gold to him. He took them home and pressed them, possibly had
them as long as he lived.
</p><p>
The name "Magarey" always honored in the Campbell Home, is it
strange that when Alex. came to the United States the next time it was
for the express purpose of bearing to his Australian home a bride&mdash;niece
of Alexander Campbell?
</p><p>
These young men (A. T. and S. J. Magarey) were my ideals of what
young Christians ought to be and do: they were so congenial to me&mdash;my
companions even playmates, sympathized with me so fully, helped
me in my work, that when their earthly life ended it seemed that
a part of my own life had gone with them.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Philip Santo&mdash;a prince among men&mdash;a generous, sympathetic soul
"Come to see us", was his message to me, "Jeff." (T. J. Gore)
"wants to see you&mdash;I will take no excuse". Of course, I had to go.
When we had enjoyed his home for a while he sent "Jeff." and me
to the seaside&mdash;to Port Elliot, the farthest limit of land toward the
South. Up on the immense cliff at the hotel we feasted the body
and rested, while we looked far out over the Southern ocean
toward the South Pole. At night the tide would lash the waves up in
sprays to the very top of this cliff: in the afternoon we strolled the
beach, gathering shells, and leaving our little (?) footprints to be
washed away at even. Every year T. J. Gore visits Port Elliot with
his family for a season; and a picture of it hangs on the wall at Carr-Burdette
College.
</p><p>
Philip Santo, happy man, was always planning, preparing something
for the good of the Church. He would sit in his Library at
night and read until absorbed in some happy thought he would say:
"Jeff., what does this Scripture mean?" and then he would be silent
until next Lord's day morning when "Jeff." would be delighted with
the lesson, and the exhortation Philip Santo would give at the church.
Those who heard him speak in the House of Parliament were glad to
hear him in the Church; for in the honesty of his soul he ministered
in each place. When I bade him good-by he insisted that I take fifty
dollars; for, said he, "I do not permit the preachers to come to see
me at their own expense".
</p><p>
He visited us in Hobart City, Tasmania. He entered the store of
his old time friend, with a cordial greeting. "How do you prosper"?
The friend, a hypercalvinist, he who heard O. A. Carr gladly, read
Milligan's Scheme of redemption and pronounced it the best book,
next to his Bible, he had ever seen, "but who drew back when he
heard a sermon on 'My Sheep'&mdash;"Very well indeed," he said, "until
the preacher (Carr) began to preach Campbellism". "What is that
you said he preached", said Santo. "What is Campbellism?" "Oh,
I don't know; but that is what they said he preached". Then he enveloped
himself in a mist of dreary theology, and proceeded into the
darkness of the decrees of foreknowledge and "fixed the fate" of all,
as he thought. Whereupon Santo remarked: "Do you think that
any man of ordinary sense can understand what you have been saying?"
Our friend was a good man, and he could bear it, when
Philip Santo said it; but he went into the other room to cool off; but
soon returned to indulge in reminiscences. He read in a few days the
announcement that "The Hon. Philip Santo, from Adelaide, would
preach the next Lord's day in O. A. Carr's place". Then it was revealed
that he had given himself away together with his cause; but
he continued to maintain stoutly that a "sheep could never become
a goat".
</p><p>
On leaving us he said: "I want to give you this: you may need
some pocket change"&mdash;and placed $50.00 in my hand. Thus he
moved around among the churches&mdash;distributing to the necessity of
saints like he was "given to hospitality" in his home.
</p><p>
His heart's desire was to visit his brethren in America. His active
business life forbade a lingering while here. He telegraphed to me to
meet him in St. Louis. Feeling that we must have him in our home
at Columbia, my answer was to tell him how he could come, and be
sure to come; but he must set sail from California at a fixed date
and could not. We missed the joy of his presence. How I would
love now to have the opportunity to do his bidding; but he has gone
from the earthly life.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> By association with him and his family in his own home I learned
to love Thomas Magarey, and henceforth to think of him very much
as his sons thought, and to feel that he was a father to us all to correct
and to help us. He could not offend me if he would by any
strange position he might take, or any thing he might say; nor would
he intentionally do so. He was born to be heard, to say what should
be in the affairs of men. Right or wrong in what he claimed as
truth, he was a genuine man.</p>

The letter was discovered recently with "the little wild
flower gathered on the plains of Sharon" pinned to it: the letter had
never been mailed: written thirty-three years ago, it shows how Mrs.
Carr talked to her girls. Possibly she wondered why "Maria" did not
answer her letter, and here is the letter found in a pigeon hole at the
College. Mr. Carr sends it on to Maria with apology.

<div class="signature">
"Fulton, Mo., U.S.A., January 8th, 1877"
</div>
<p>"My Dear Maria:<br />
</p>

<p>I received a letter from Maggie a few days since in which she
stated that you had written to me, but receiving no answer, feel discouraged
to write again. Be assured your letter never reached me,
or it would have been answered. I often think of my dear girls in
Australia, and especially of you and Maggie, because I loved you best
of all my pupils in Melbourne; for my association with you was
longest and most intimate, and because your mothers were friends
that never failed me amid the little annoyances and trials that life is
so surely heir to. I cannot tell you how much I long to see you all
once more. I cannot imagine how you think for a moment that I
forget you. I wrote you from Jerusalem. I wrote to you from
Rome, and I sent you a French Journal from Paris. I would love to
visit you in your happy home that Maggie so graphically described
and to see that beautiful boy upon whom she lavished so many
praises. Vaney a husband and father, and my little Maria a wife and
mother! Well, I am truly glad it is so, and pray that your lives may
be happy and useful. After all, Maria, the sweetest thing in life is the
privilege of <span class="smcap">BEING USEFUL</span>&mdash;the privilege of <span class="smcap">WORK</span>. What greater
blessing, beyond redemption, can a woman ask than the privilege of
serving her husband and her generation. We are now stationed in a
very pretty little city in Missouri and our work is pleasant. Mr. Carr
preaches for the Church here, and I have charge of Floral Hill College.
My school is prospering and I am very happy in my work.
Tell Miss Ashley I wish she were here to work with me. However,
we may have the happiness of working together in Australia. Every
winter I pine for the hot winds&mdash;yes&mdash;<span class="smcap">THE HOT WINDS</span>&mdash;of Australia.
My health has been poor during the winters ever since our return to
America. We may meet you all again. How are Brother and Sister
Magarey and family? Remember us very kindly to them all, also to
Brother and Sister Santo and family, especially to <span class="smcap">Ettie</span>. We had a
short, but pleasant intercourse with Alex. (Magarey) during his visit
to America. Extend our congratulations to him and his bride, and
our best wishes for their happiness and usefulness." [Alex. had
come to the United States to marry Miss Campbell of Bethany, Va..&mdash;niece
of Alex. Campbell&mdash;O. A. C.]

"The snow is falling drearily and the snow birds are hopping about
cheerily, as though the snow was the greatest boon that God ever
bestowed upon his creatures. It is not 'The Rainy Day,' but the
spirit of Longfellow is about me. By the way, during my tour East
last summer, I called upon the grand old poet, and had a happy talk
with him in his own historic drawing room. As you doubtless know,
the Longfellow Mansion was at one time during the Revolution the
headquarters of General Washington. Longfellow is one of the few
glorious poetic spirits that have withstood the corrupting influence of
the world's applause. When I visited the Centennial Exposition I
availed myself of the privilege of visiting many places of historic
interest in the East. This is the only tour that I ever made through
the Eastern States <span class="smcap">EXPRESSLY</span> for information, and I need not tell you
that I enjoyed it intensely and feel greatly benefited thereby. When
I see you, you shall have all particulars. Now, Maria, you must not
fail to answer without delay. [What grief it gave Mrs. Carr that she
did not have a letter from Maria&mdash;because this letter was not posted!]
Write me a 'chatty' letter. Tell me how you like housekeeping, if
baby ever has the colic, if Vaney kisses him over a dozen times a day,
etc., etc. Give my love to your mother and tell her I would love to
receive one more pledge of her friendship in the form of a letter for
the sake of 'Auld Lang Syne.' Or if she is the busy housewife of
yore, she can press Willie into service. Remember us very kindly to
our friend, the Scotchman, your father and Mr. Jacques.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
